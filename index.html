<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Who Killed These Girls?: The Unsolved Murders That Rocked a Texas Town</h2><p><p>The facts are brutally straightforward. On December 6, 1991, the naked, bound-and-gagged, burned bodies of four girls--each one shot in the head--were found in a frozen yogurt shop in Austin, Texas. Grief, shock, and horror overtook the city. But after eight years of misdirected investigations, only two suspects (teenagers at the time of the crime) were tried; their convictions were later overturned and detectives are still working on what is now a very cold case. The story has grown to include DNA technology, coerced false confessions, and other developments in crime and punishment. But this story belongs to the scores of people involved, and from them Beverly Lowry has fashioned a riveting saga that reads like a novel, heart-stopping and thoroughly engrossing.</p></p><p><b>BEVERLY LOWRY</b>&nbsp;is the author of six novels and three previous works of nonfiction.

She lives in Austin, Texas.December 6, 1991<br><br>When the call came in, Austin Police Department&#x2019;s Sgt. John Winston Jones was the only homicide cop on the street. That&#x2019;s how small and safe a city Austin was back then. Close to midnight on a Friday night and Jones was it. When his mobile rang the first time, he was on the other side of town, at Airport and Martin Luther King boulevards, following up an earlier call, a guy who&#x2019;d barricaded himself inside a building and was threatening to kill himself.<br><br>Jones punched in.<br><br>&#x201c;Two fatalities,&#x201d; the dispatcher told him, &#x201c;suspected arson, suspected homicide, looks like gunshot wounds.&#x201d; And he gave him the address: I Can&#x2019;t Believe It&#x2019;s Yogurt!, 2949 West Anderson Lane. Everything about that night was unusual, including the fact that two people had ridden out with Jones, a reporter and photographer from KTBC-�TV, a local CBS affiliate doing a series on homicides in Texas. So far, except for a couple of weenie calls, the ride had been a bust. &#x201c;Nothing happens in Austin,&#x201d; the reporter complained. But never mind. They were heading to Houston the next day, where they&#x2019;d surely score.<br><br>Abandoning the would-�be suicide, Jones cranked his unmarked sedan, switched on his lights and siren and, once his riders were settled in the backseat, hit the ramp leading to the interstate. If working in law enforcement had taught him anything, it was that there was no such thing as a routine call, but this one sounded ominous. Crime in northwest Austin was rare, murders all but nonexistent&#x2014;�and in a frozen-�yogurt shop?<br><br>In no time the next call came in. They&#x2019;d found another body.<br><br>From the backseat, the cameraman videotaped John&#x2014;�dressed in dark pants, a black windbreaker and a long-�sleeved white dress shirt with pale green stripes&#x2014;�as he blazed north on I-35. After tonight, he will hang the shirt on a wall at APD headquarters, a symbol of Homicide&#x2019;s determination to find the killers. &#x201c;When you see me wearing this shirt,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told the victims&#x2019; families, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll know the case is solved.&#x201d; It will remain on the wall for months. It hangs in his closet to this day.<br><br>He was in sight of Highway 183 when the numbers of his mobile lit up again.<br><br>&#x201c;Jonesy,&#x201d; said a cop on the scene. &#x201c;Make that four.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Jones said. &#x201c;Here we go.&#x201d;<br><br>Girls. Kids. Bound, gagged. Naked. Stacked. Burned to the bone.<br><br>When I tell people about the case, one of the first things they want to know is, How old were they? Two were seventeen, I tell them. One was fifteen and the youngest, thirteen, was still in the eighth grade. Two were sisters.<br><br>And was robbery the motive?<br><br>Absolutely not.<br><br>The next thing they ask is, Was race an issue? Were the girls black? Latina? What about the suspects?<br><br>So far, the only person of color known to have been directly involved in what is unfailingly called the &#x201c;Yogurt Shop Murders&#x201d; was the lead cop, Sgt. John W. Jones, who arrived at the scene shortly after midnight. By then, Hillside Center was lit up like a nighttime movie set. Fire trucks, police cars, flashers. Harsh generator-�powered lights in the alley mounted on steel girders high above the flat rooftops.<br><br>He pulled in. Hillside&#x2019;s an ordinary strip center, concrete blocks, concrete flooring, each store with its name and logo on a ledge above the door. The yogurt shop was dark, its wide front window blackened from smoke and soot, the sign above reading i can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s . . . in modern sans serif and yogurt! in swirls, like the cones it sold. Next door, the Party House logo featured red balloons tied together in a bunch, heading skyward as if to escape. After telling the reporters to stay put, Jones headed toward one of the policemen stretching the yellow crime-�scene tape. Earlier in the night, the videographer had clipped a microphone to Jones&#x2019;s belt, but, much to John&#x2019;s relief, its batteries had gone dead; otherwise, CBS would have recorded his every word, including a few choice expletives. Because the fire department had set up its staging area in the parking lot, the APD cop advised him to go through the Party House.<br><br>When he got to the alley, the steel doors to the storage room of the yogurt shop were wide open. Jones stepped inside.<br><br>&#x201c;I look in there and I go, Oh my God. There were puddles of water all over the place. The bodies were still smoldering. There was insulation from the ceiling that had dropped down. And it was hot. It was smoky. And I was by myself.&#x201d;<br><br>His next thought? &#x201c;I needed help. I&#x2019;d been a policeman for twenty-�one years and I&#x2019;d never seen anything like it.&#x201d;<br><br>First homicide cop on the scene, old-�school protocol says the case is his. Jones went to work.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t live in Austin then, but I had family here and visited often. I heard about the murders immediately, and every time I went back it seemed something new had happened: another whacked-�out confession, a new tip, a bigger reward, the arrests, trials, Supreme Court decisions, reversals. You didn&#x2019;t have to live here at the time to know the story. Say &#x201c;yogurt shop&#x201d; in Austin even today and locals jump to &#x201c;murders&#x201d; before you get there. Lawyers just say Yogurt Shop. Some even cut that short. You here for Yogurt? is a question I&#x2019;ve been asked more than once.<br><br>We tag unspeakable crimes for a number of reasons, one of which springs from our wish never again to have to describe or even imagine the horrible event. Sometimes the name emerges from the killer (Manson, Jack the Ripper, the Boston Strangler) or the victim (JonBen�t, Lindbergh, the Black Dahlia), or, now and then, the weapon, whether Pickax or Broomstick. When the World Trade Center buildings went down, we focused on the date and used only the two numbers. Like the mass shootings at Columbine High and at Luby&#x2019;s Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, the rape, murder and burning of the four Austin girls was named for the place where the crime occurred and for the same reason: A more unlikely place for random savagery could hardly be imagined (if it turns out that random even applies).<br><br>In 1991, Austin was on the verge of becoming what it is today, but back then nobody had a clue. The go-�to Texas cities were Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. With its big-�time celebration of Eeyore&#x2019;s birthday, its dog parades, costumes and flummery, Austin was Slackerville, rock music, goofball pot smokers and drunken legislators, a city where unreconstructed hippies and university students swam naked in nearby lakes and sometimes had sex in the bushes. While Houstonians liked to say Austin was hoping to become a grown-�up city, too, someday, nobody here took offense. Who wanted to be like Houston?<br><br>Then came Yogurt Shop. We lost our innocence that night became an official mantra among politicians and self-�congratulating residents who considered innocence a concrete possibility instead of a handy, if unrealistic, construct. And then, when the crime remained unresolved year after year after year, it became a permanent part of our history.<br><br>I once asked my son, who lived here then and still does, &#x201c;Will the Yogurt Shop Murders ever be out of our lives?&#x201d;<br><br>His answer came fast. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re with us forever.&#x201d;<br><br>He might be right.<br><br>By the summer of 2009, when I stepped into the long, tortured path of the story, I&#x2019;d lived in Austin for three years. The crime was eighteen years old by then, but resolution&#x2014;�the exorcism we all longed for&#x2014;�still seemed a distant hope. Between 1991, when John Jones became lead investigator, and 1994, when he was removed from the case, a high-�stakes investigation had yielded hot tips, FBI assurances and urgent confessions but no arrests. Then nothing. The case went cold until 1999, when, after a new task force was appointed, two boys confessed and implicated two of their running buddies. All four were arrested and charged with capital murder. Those who&#x2019;d confessed were indicted, tried, found guilty and, by 2003, had been sent to state prison: one for life, the other to await execution. The third&#x2014;�called &#x201c;Action Man,&#x201d; widely assumed to be the ringleader&#x2014;�was indicted and locked up in county jail for a while but, for lack of evidence, was eventually released: no trial. The fourth&#x2014;�a boy of fifteen when the crime occurred&#x2014;�was never indicted. Nobody on the prosecutorial team was happy about those two going free, especially Action Man, though at least they&#x2019;d nailed the first pair, who the DA figured would surely flip on their cohorts once prison life got to them.<br><br>For a while, that seemed to be that. But even then, some people thought the equation of four bad guys for four good girls, while satisfying, might be, if anything, a little too perfect. And the story kept jumping back to reset, with disruptions of one kind and another: appeals, reversals, higher-�court decisions. Shortly after I made Austin my home, both convictions were overturned and the suspects remanded to Travis County District Court 167, where they had been tried originally. By 2009, retrials had been lined up. Same courtroom, same defense attorneys, defendants and judge, different prosecutors, new district attorney. Jury selection for the first trial had been scheduled for early July, the second to follow immediately after. The judge, whose rulings had been publicly slammed, was pushing hard; he wanted this thing, by God, to be over.<br><br>All of this was in the air when, in June of that year, I went to a Yogurt Shop hearing. I hadn&#x2019;t decided what I wanted to do with whatever I saw, heard or learned there but did know why the long, unsettled history of the case drew me to it and why I thought it might be my story to tell. So did my family and friends.<br><br>I sat on the left side of the aisle, unaware that courtrooms have seating conventions, like weddings, and that I&#x2019;d chosen the prosecutorial side of the room, along with police and families of the victims. Not that it mattered. Only to say, that&#x2019;s how much I knew.<br><br>In movies, courtrooms are usually grandly appointed sanctuaries, all dark and with ornately carved mahogany and high arched ceilings, perhaps an upstairs gallery and sometimes a bronze statue of blindfolded Lady Justice holding the scales. In And Justice for All, Al Pacino makes his plea to a judge sitting so high above the defense table that the lawyers have to crane their necks to make eye contact. Behind the judge, a wall of marble extends to the ceiling. Even small-�town courtrooms like those in To Kill a Mockingbird and A Time to Kill manage to communicate the fearful dignity and weight of the law. They are like glorified vaults.<br><br>Courtrooms in the Travis County Blackwell-�Thurman Criminal Justice Center exude no such grand sense of purpose. They are just rooms, utilitarian and unremarkable. Fluorescent tubing inserted into a low ceiling of ordinary soundproofing casts an unflattering yellowish glare down gray grainy-�surfaced walls. And while the judge sits properly elevated above everybody else, the bench&#x2014;�his desk&#x2014;�does not parallel the back wall but is situated in a corner, at an angle to participants and spectators.<br><br>For the press, Yogurt Shop had been a honeypot from day one. Call a hearing or mention a name and everybody showed up. On this occasion, print reporters&#x2014;�many of whom had attended the original trials&#x2014;�sat together on the defense side of the aisle, chatting amiably. Photographers and videographers had gathered along the front row of the jury box, their cameras aimed at the door the defendant would walk through: not the placid, loopy guy, but the snarly one with the scary eyebrows, the mullet haircut and the famous rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll surname. Behind the camera crew were fourteen black leather chairs with high backs and headrests. Wooden benches in the spectator section were padded, a blessing when a trial goes on and on, as death-�penalty trials like Yogurt Shop always do. There was seating for maybe sixty observers, if that. During the earlier trials, the judge had sent a live video feed to a nearby room for the daily overflow.<br><br>When the armed deputy from the sheriff&#x2019;s department ushered in the defendant, cameras whirred and clicked. Dressed in a navy sport coat, black leather shoes and dark gray pants, Robert Burns Springsteen IV looked calm and pulled together&#x2014;�respectable instead of unkempt and defiant, as he had during his trial. He sat at the defense table between two lawyers: a handsome silver-�haired man and a large woman carrying an open briefcase jammed with files and knitting.<br><br>When the bailiff instructed us to &#x201c;All rise,&#x201d; the judge swooped in. A small man, wiry, goateed, as quick-�witted and intense as a terrier, Mike Lynch took his seat and, after a quick &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; brusquely addressed the courtroom.<br><br>&#x201c;The only reason we&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is for me to hear both sides argue about the significance of the new DNA test results.&#x201d; The session, he declared, would be short. There would be no expert witnesses and he didn&#x2019;t want to hear a lot of technical data about what had been done or why it was or wasn&#x2019;t valid. He didn&#x2019;t want to hear about the science of DNA. All he wanted to know was, from each perspective, what the results were and why they mattered. Was that clear?<br><br>His glittering blue eyes scanned the courtroom. Having been born and raised in Arkansas, Lynch made use of his cracker-�tinged accent much like Lyndon Johnson had, gaining advantage by emphasizing his aw-�shucks country-�hick roots and subsequent lack of sophistication, a ruse that, in both instances, worked startlingly well. Often called the best-�liked judge in Travis County, he&#x2019;d sat on the 167 bench since 1993.<br><br>After lawyers on both sides promised to follow the judge&#x2019;s instructions, the lead defense attorney stood. Perfectly tanned and immaculately dressed in his seasonal best&#x2014;�wheat-�colored linen jacket, dark trousers, a crisp white shirt perfectly accessorized with a silk tie and cuff links made of gold coins&#x2014;�he epitomized the &#x201c;white-�shoe lawyer,&#x201d; his silver hair shaped in a perfect razor cut and his black cowboy boots polished to a high sheen. You will rarely see him dressed less elegantly. Joe James &#x201c;Jim&#x201d; Sawyer was known for his flamboyance, literary references and courtroom maneuvers, as well as his movie-�star smile and love of the camera. When I asked why he took on Yogurt Shop, he smiled broadly. &#x201c;I have a big ego,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was the biggest thing to hit Travis County and I wanted in.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Hooligans of Kandahar: Not All War Stories are Heroic</h2><p><b>Not Every War Story is Heroic</b><br><br>During the peak of the Afghanistan War, a group of soldiers is dropped by helicopter into the remote mountains outside of Kandahar City. Mismanaged and overlooked by command, the squad must rely on each other to survive. <br><br>Their mission is to train and advise the Afghan National Police and help rebuild the country of Afghanistan. The Afghan Police station they are assigned to live in is falling apart and disease-ridden. Many of the police officers they are supposed to train are Taliban sleeper agents or the family of Taliban fighters. The ones that aren&#x2019;t are often addicted to drugs, illiterate, or smuggling child slaves. <br><br>The squad is led by Slim, a Staff Sergeant in his late twenties who has so many mental issues his insanity is his most dominant personality trait. An alcoholic with a penchant for violent outbursts against both his own soldiers and the Afghans, he is more comfortable at war than at home. <br><br>Joseph Kassabian is the youngest and most junior fire team leader in the squad. He&#x2019;s charged with leading a team of soldiers not even old enough to drink. He himself is only 21 years old. As a combat veteran from previous deployments with four years in the Army, he assumes he has seen it all. But he has no idea how bad things can get in war-torn Kandahar.<br><br>In the birthplace of the Taliban, some men lose their lives, some lose their sanity, and others their humanity. They are The Hooligans.</p><p>Joseph Kassabian was born and raised in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan and enlisted in the U.S. Army in December of 2005 at the age of 17. He served multiple combat tours in support of the Global War On Terror, including the one covered in this book. In 2013, he exited the Army with an Honorable Discharge and began a career in writing. He currently lives in the Seattle area. You can follow Joseph on Twitter @jkass99</p><h2>Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. Translated and edited by Louis J. Puhl</h2><p>2010 Reprint of 1951 Edition. The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, (composed from 1522-1524) are a brief set of Christian meditations, prayers and mental exercises, divided in four thematic &#39;weeks&#39; of variable length, designed to be carried out over a period of 28 to 30 days. They were composed to help to discern Jesus in everyday life. Though the underlying spiritual outlook is Catholic, the exercises are often made nowadays by non-Catholics. The &#39;Spiritual Exercises&#39; booklet was formally approved in 1548 by Paul III and serves as a foundation document for the Jesuit order.</p><p></p><h2>The Mailroom: Hollywood History from the Bottom Up</h2><p>It&#x2019;s like a plot from a Hollywood potboiler: start out in the mailroom, end up a mogul.

My mother was one of his seven sisters, and whenever he was in town, we'd all go to see him perform. I loved being backstage near talented people.<br><br>My mother wanted me to go to college. I'd rather have hung out with the guys and played ball, or gone to a poolroom, or chased the girls, but school is what she wanted. When she died young, in July 1937, I immediately dropped out of school and went to work. Another uncle, Willie Burns--George's manager and writer--called Abe Lastfogel, the boss at the William Morris Agency, and asked him to give me a job of any sort. Nat Lefkowitz and Morris Stoller interviewed me, and in August 1937, when I was nineteen, I got a job as an office boy at twelve dollars a week.<br><br>sol leon: I grew up in Brooklyn. My father was in the women's coats and suits business. He was able to put me through the first year of college at NYU-Heights, but when the Depression hit he said, "Sorry. I can't afford to send you back."<br><br>I got a job and went to Brooklyn Law at night. I sat next to Nat Lefkowitz in class for four years; it was alphabetical. Morris Stoller was also there. Lefkowitz and Stoller worked at William Morris; Nat practically ran the place under Bill Morris Jr. When I became disenchanted with the law, I asked him to find a place for me.<br><br>I started October 1, 1938; I was twenty-five. Nat made me head of the mailroom, while Stoller trained me in business affairs. I had nothing directly to do with handling mail. My job was to tear off the Teletypes and distribute them. Get theater tickets. Get train tickets for Mr. Lastfogel; he didn't fly to California then. Anything that had to be delivered or sorted, I'd delegate. I just told the kids what to do.<br><br>weiss: Before Sol Leon came to oversee the mailroom, "Uncle Henry"--Bill Morris Sr.'s wife's cousin--supervised the office boys. He was an elderly guy who didn't hesitate to crack the whip and make sure we weren't off playing cards someplace. I wish now that I had behaved myself better. I wasted a lot of time. I'd rather have gone dancing than deliver a script, listen to great bands and vocalists in Harlem than sort mail. I hung out at the Savoy Ballroom and watched Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald and Ellington. I was also hooked on comics and comedy writers. I loved to go to Lindy's and hang around, try to get myself recognized.<br><br>leon: I wanted to fire Lou Weiss, but I couldn't because he was George Burns's nephew.<br><br>weiss: Maybe because I always dressed better than Sol Leon [laughs]. He'd get very upset.<br><br>larry auerbach: My father was in the dairy restaurant business in Brooklyn. After the stock market crashed, he opened a smaller place but he didn't own the building, and when the city built a new highway, they tore it down, leaving him to sell off his tables and chairs. He was dejected and sad, and the pain of watching him spend more than a year looking for another situation is still vivid.<br><br>I had a work ethic early. When school let out for the summer, I'd always find a job. At twelve I helped my grandparents at their cleaning store, making deliveries. At thirteen I worked for a friend of the family, stacking cans neatly in the Epicurean Department of Gimbel's. The next summer a friend to whom my uncle sold stationery asked me, "Would you like to work in a theatrical agency?"<br><br>I had no idea what that was, so he told me a little bit about it, and I said, "Yeah, it sounds better than delivering suits."<br><br>I got the job at William Morris in June 1944. It was just for the summer, running things around town, mimeographing. I didn't care. It was New York, the big city, exciting and glamorous. I was just shy of fifteen, a little younger than most people in the mailroom. A few years later I was also the youngest ever made an agent at William Morris--to my knowledge. Norman Brokaw claims he was, but what's the difference now?<br><br>hilly elkins: I went to the theater often and from the first was attracted to the idea of putting together what I saw on the stage. When I was fifteen I auditioned for a radio program at WNYC and got in. I ran the sound board, produced, directed, wrote, acted.<br><br>At Brooklyn College my drama coach was Gordon Davidson's dad. Gordon--who has for years been artistic director of the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum of Los Angeles--and I were friends and opened a tent theater in Belle Harbor. I had a combination job: producer, star, and janitor. It didn't lose too much money, but we ran it into the ground.<br><br>I thought maybe learning the agency business would be a good way of getting a rounded entertainment education. People were in either the theater, nightclubs, or motion pictures. But now it was the beginning of television. Milton Berle and the Colgate Comedy Hour. The only players were William Morris and what was then MCA. I thought it was an interesting opportunity.<br><br>I came in cold. Sid Feinberg interviewed me. I was eighteen; I already had my college degree and was starting law school. I gave it up for a job in the mailroom.<br><br>leonard hirshan: I could say I loved movies and went all the time when I was ten years old, and knew about directors and scripts, and loved the actors, and said to my father that one day I would grow up and be an agent--but that's not true. No one tells their parents they want to grow up to be an agent. Until I applied for a job at William Morris, I hadn't the slightest idea of what the agency business was, or any desire to be in show business. The fates pushed me there.<br><br>I got out of the navy in December 1947 and applied to NYU. I'm a very compulsive person, so I went to school all year long and graduated in about half the normal time, in August 1950, on a Friday. Having been accepted at NYU law school, I started the next Monday, but after a few months I burned out. I decided to take a leave of absence after the first semester, get a job for a while, and then go back.<br><br>I asked my uncle, who had booked shows at the Temple Emmanuel, what kind of temporary situations I could find. He lived in the same building as Nat Kalcheim, an important agent at the Morris office, who told him to have me call Sid Feinberg.<br><br>RULE #1<br><br>weiss: We called the boss Mr. Lastfogel, never Abe. Years later I was sitting with him and Elvis' manager, Colonel Parker at Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles, and Colonel Parker said, "Abe, why don't you let Lou call you Abe?"<br><br>Mr. Lastfogel said, "He can call me Abe."<br><br>I said, "I don't call my father Sam. I'm not going to call you Abe."<br><br>It was automatic with all of us.<br><br>hirshan: There was a Nedicks stand in the lobby of our building, 1270 Sixth Avenue, where they sold hot dogs and orange drinks. Whenever I walked by, I'd want something to eat and drink, but I wouldn't do it because I didn't want anyone from the office to think that's where I got my food--until the day I saw Mr. Lastfogel standing there with a hot dog and drink. That's when I realized the democracy of William Morris and dropped all my airs.<br><br>weiss: Mrs. Lastfogel--Frances Arms--was a comic and a performer, and it was rare that she'd ever come up to the office. But one day she did and said, "Get Lou Weiss out of the stockroom." I couldn't imagine what she wanted. To my surprise she said, "Lou, let me see the new dance steps." We put on a record and I danced with the boss's wife. I couldn't say no. Even after I became an agent, whenever she and the boss were in town, she'd say, "Lou, hang around."<br><br>KIDS AT WORK<br><br>weiss: First I was a delivery person. If an actor had to sign a contract, you got on a bus, went to the actor's house. I once waited for Mae West to sign a piece of paper. That was exciting.<br><br>hirshan: I was told to deliver a script to Judy Garland at the Palace Theater. It was a matinee day. I brought it over between shows. I went down to the dumpy-looking dressing rooms, looked in one, and saw a little girl in a ratty bathrobe sitting on the floor watching television. I said, "Excuse me, young lady. Do you know where I can find Judy Garland?" She turned around and said, "I am Judy Garland." It was so embarrassing.<br><br>auerbach: I delivered to Marilyn Monroe. She had just started, but I knew who she was. Her guy at William Morris was Johnny Hyde, a terrific agent, and there was some romance going on between them. I also took something to Gloria DeHaven. She opened the door in her underwear. I was too young to know if I was getting an invitation to come inside, and if I was, I didn't know what to do about it. The only thing I remember is that her underwear was pink. Later I decided that I had really blown it!<br><br>weiss: Belle Baker was not quite Sophie Tucker, but she was an important client who'd made a name for herself in vaudeville. She had an apartment on Central Park West. I had to get her to sign a contract. Her little dog yapped the whole time I stood in the vestibule. When I went out, the dog bit me. I stood there, my leg bleeding, afraid to go back in. At the office I told Morris Stoller what had happened.<br><br>He sent me to a doctor, who said the board of health had to get the dog. But Belle Baker had left town. They found her working in Atlantic City. They grabbed the dog and checked it out for hydrophobia. Thank God it was clean.<br><br>auerbach: By 1944, Sid Feinberg, a lovely man, oversaw the trainees. He was deathly afraid of Nat Lefkowitz, his boss. There was a cutout window between their offices, and when Nat would open it and say, "Sid!" he'd jump. Sid had the tough job of telling us when we did things wrong, and what to do. One day he told me the company wanted to paint the office walls but didn't have the money. Would I be interested in putting together a group of kids and whitewashing the walls? You bet. Then one guy stood on William Morris Jr.'s desk to reach the ceiling and broke the glass top. Of course we denied it was us.<br><br>hirshan: According to tradition, on my first day I was taken in to meet William Morris Jr. He looked up at me from behind his desk and said, "Ah. Another capitalist." I thought, I'm making $38.50 a week. What is he talking about? But he was right. I didn't understand. He was saying that in the agency business if you become successful, you make a good living. My game plan was if I didn't get out of the mailroom in a year, I would go back to law school. If I got promoted, loved what I was doing, but didn't make agent in two years, I'd also leave. But I was willing to give it a chance because almost immediately show business had seduced me.<br><br>DRESS THE PART<br><br>elkins: One joke around the mailroom was the way I dressed--considering the salary. I did that on purpose. Everybody had to wear suits, but there are suits and there are suits. I went over the edge. I was very chic.<br><br>One of my first delivery runs was to the Berle show. Milton, at that time, was Mr. Television. He ran the rehearsals a little bit like Auschwitz, but he got the goddamn shows on. I came in with a package, and he said, "Who are you?"<br><br>"Hilly Elkins."<br><br>He looked at my clothes. He said, "And what do you do?"<br><br>"I'm one of your agents," I said. I don't think he believed me, but he said nothing.<br><br>READ EVERYTHING!<br><br>auerbach: A college education wasn't yet required to get into the mailroom then. All you needed were street smarts and the ability to deal with a situation on your feet. There was no book to read, no school to go to that would tell you how.<br><br>The mailroom was my school. I made it my business to read every piece of paper I could get my hands on. Booking sheets. Internal memos. Meeting minutes. I memorized important telephone numbers. I sopped up information. They didn't tell you to do that or not do that, but only a schmuck wouldn't read stuff before be delivered it. It was very glamorous to learn about the money the performers received. Some got paid so much, the salaries read like telephone numbers, and it's still that way, only now the numbers include area codes. I thought these people must have been like God to get that kind of money.<br><br>elkins: An early assignment was to take Abe Lastfogel's New York bankbooks in for interest to be recorded. I went to ten banks, each with the maximum of $100,000, and I had them stamped. I figured if his New York money alone was a million bucks, it's got to be a good business.<br><br>A MATTER OF DEGREE<br><br>weiss: Everybody wants to be in show business. Today a thousand college graduates show up every June to go into our training program, when there's room for just a few. We eventually drew the line at college degrees to thin out the number of applicants. At least we wouldn't be getting the high school dropouts; we'd get people who were educated and ready to face the next step in life.<br><br>auerbach: They'll kick me in the ass for saying this, but the truth is that the reason a college degree became important was not to have to accept every minority applicant. That's where it started. At some point you could no longer say no to minorities, because you would face legal problems, so they required a degree.</p><h2>Dragon Ball (3-in-1 Edition), Vol. 6: Includes vols. 16, 17 &amp; 18</h2><p>The Greatest Hero on Earth Goku and Piccolo finally face each other down in the final match of the Tenka&#x2019;ichi Bud&#x14d;kai!

As Mark Kurlansky so brilliantly relates here, salt has shaped civilization from the beginning, and its story is a glittering often surprising part of the history of mankind. So valuable that it has often served as currency and still does in places today, salt inspired the earliest trade routes across unknown oceans and the remotest deserts. Wars have been fought over salt, and while salt taxes secured empires across Europe and Asia, they have also inspired revolution - Gandhi&#39;s salt march in 1930 began the overthrow of British rule in India. From the rural Sichuan province where the last home-made soya sauce is made to the Cheshire brine springs that supplied salt around the globe, Mark Kurlansky has produced a kaleidoscope of world history, a multilayered masterpiece that blends political, commercial, scientific, religious and culinary records into a rich and memorable tale.</p><p>This definitive audiobook about salt will take you through the history and importance of salt as not only our only edible rock, but as a currency, a necessary mineral, a preservative, a curative, and a huge part of our vocabulary. Salt has had an important part in our history and this audiobook is an amusing and informative narrative. Mark Kurlansky traveled the world to study salt and its critical importance to civilization. This fun read is enlightening and thoroughly enjoyable at the same time."Kurlansky continues to prove himself remarkably adept at taking a most unlikely candidate and telling its tale with epic grandeur. <b>Salt: A World History</b> reveals all the hidden drama of its seemingly pedestrian subject&#x2026;. an immensely entertaining read.&#x201d; -- <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Stylishly written and wonderfully learned &#x2026; William Blake famously suggested that the world was to be seen in a grain of sand; Kurlansky has seen it in a grain of salt.&#x201d; -- <i>The Observer</i> <br> <br>"Mark Kurlansky&#x2019;s almost 500-page opus on earth&#x2019;s only edible rock is the stuff of which epics are born&#x2026;." -- Zsuzsi Gartner, <i>The Globe and Mail</i>, Saturday, January 26, 2002 <br> <br>"In <i> </i> <b>Salt</b>, Mark Kurlansky, who charmed readers with an entertaining volume on the codfish, turns to a chemical that is essential to human life&#x2026;.darned interesting&#x2026;.

He resides in Cincinnati, Ohio, and spends summers in Assisi as a staff member of Franciscan Pilgrimage Programs.In a soft, lilting voice Murray Bodo narrates vignettes from the life of Saint Francis, whom many know as the man who talked with birds and animals. Bodo speaks with a light accent as he recounts different scenes from Saint Francis's life and dreams. From his boyhood among wealthy nobility to his conversion experience while observing a crucifix at San Damiano and the creation of his religious order, which focused on helping the poor, each account is rendered with empathy and sensitivity.

Joe is lately a PR man for the Amazing Kingdom theme park, but now that the voles are gone, Winder is dragged along in their wake through a series of weird and lethal events that begin with the sleazy real-estate agent/villain Francis X. Kingsbury and can end only one way....Carl Hiaasen (pronounced &#34;hiya-sun&#34;) was born and raised in South Florida and presently lives in Tavernier, smack in the middle of the Florida Keys. He attended Emory University and was graduated with a degree in journalism from the University of Florida at Gainesville in 1974. Hiaasen began his journalism career writing weird public interest stories (&#34;Garbageman for a day&#34;) at Cocoa Today (now the Melbourne-based Florida Today). He joined the Miami Herald in 1976, and since then has been a reporter for their general assignment desk, Sunday magazine and investigative team. As part of The Miami Herald&#39;s investigative team, Hiaasen has worked on projects exposing dangerous doctors in Florida, land corruption in the Florida Keys, and drug smuggling in the Bahamas and Key West. He is currently Metro columnist for the paper where his award-winning columns on rapacious development, egregious business practices, and corrupt politicians have helped clarify issues for the Florida citizenry. Carl Hiaasen turned his hand to fiction in the early eighties. His first novel, Tourist Season,was published in 1986 and named &#34;one of the ten best destination reads of all time&#34; by GQ Magazine. He is the author of five other best-selling novels, Double Whammy, Skin Tight, Native Tongue, Strip Tease and Stormy Weather. Louise Bernikow, writing in Cosmopolitan, calls Hiaasen&#39;s fiction &#34;unbelievably funny -- tears-running-down-your-cheeks funny in spite of some pretty weighty themes like the destruction of the environment and the cut-throat ways of developers.&#34; Tony Hillerman calls Hiaasen &#34;the Mark Twain of the crime novel.&#34; And Donald Westlake says &#34;Hiaasen is so good he ought to be illegal.&#34; Hiaasen is also a songwriter, having co-wrote two songs on Warren Zevon&#39;s album.

She had ridden bikes since her teens and was well travelled. But nothing could prepare her for what lay ahead.When she returned to London nearly two and a half years later she was stones lighter and decades wiser. She&#39;d ridden through unforgiving landscapes and countries ravaged by war, witnessed civil uprisings that forced her to fake documents, and fended off sexual attacks, biker gangs and corrupt police convinced she was trafficking drugs. She&#39;d survived life-threatening illnesses, personal loss and brutal accidents that had left permanent scars and a black hole in her memory. And she&#39;d fallen in love with two very different men.In an age before email, the internet, mobile phones, satnavs and, in some parts of the world, readily available and reliable maps, Elspeth achieved something that would still seem remarkable today. Told with honesty and wit, this is the extraordinary and moving story of a unique and life-changing adventure.</p><p>Elspeth Beard is a motorcyclist and award-winning architect. She runs her own architecture company, specializing in creating and remodelling interesting and unusual buildings. She lives in a converted water tower in the southeast of England and still enjoys riding her collection of motorcycles, which includes her trusty BMW R 60/6.An eye-opening account of one of adventure motorcycling's most enjoyable and inspiring stories.

Look for the same thoroughly researched and wonderfully accessible comics storytelling as O'Connor tackles the story of the Aphrodite from her dramatic birth (emerging from sea-foam) to her role in the Trojan War. </p><p>O'Connor has outdone himself with this volume: the story is riveting and the artwork is beyond compare. Greek mythology has never been so vivid! This title has Common Core connections.</p><p><b>A Neal Porter Book</b></p></p><p><b>George O'Connor</b>'s hit series, <i>Olympians</i>, has landed on the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list (<i>Hades</i> and <i>Poseidon)</i> and found a devoted fan-base among readers and educators. <i>Aphrodite: Goddess of Love </i>is the latest installment in the series.Gr 6&#x2013;10&#x2014;This sixth book in the series turns its attention to the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite is created from love itself, but once born, is quickly forced by Zeus into a loveless marriage to Hephaistos, the god of fire and smithing, in order to prevent conflict among the gods. Lonely and unhappy, she gives birth to Eros (aka Cupid), which sets about a comic chain of events that will change the course of human history forever. Although this volume is not as action-focused as earlier entries, O'Connor still weaves together an interesting and at times hilarious narrative about love and jealousy. His interest in the source material is evident on every page, as he brings these gods to life with his portrayals of complex emotions and distinct personalities while his simple, modern word choices make the text easily accessible. The illustrations perfectly match the text; each character gets a sleek, modern makeover while still remaining true to the clothing of the time period, and the use of soft, pastel colors set a lighthearted tone. Endnotes explain some of the more subtle references and allusions to previous works, while discussion questions, fact sheets, and an author's note further educate readers. This volume ends with a well-plotted and humorous retelling of the Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite sets up the Trojan War wonderfully for future installments. Another strong addition to a great series.&#x2014;Peter Blenski, Greenfield Public Library, WI</p><h2>Grandma Tell Me Your Story (Keepsake Journal)</h2><p>Give your family a gift beyond compare with this beautiful keepsake journal.

It is our home, unless any of you are aliens who have secretly invaded our planet for your own purposes. If so, please see me after class.<br> <br>You might have heard or read that Columbus proved the Earth was round in 1492, when he sailed from Spain to the Caribbean. This is not even close to true! By Columbus&#x2019;s time, scientists had known the Earth was round for almost two thousand years.<br> The Shape the World Is In<p></p> <br>The earliest Greek thinkers disagreed about the shape of the Earth. Thales thought it was a round, flat disk floating in water, like a pancake that&#x2019;s fallen overboard at sea.<br> <br><br> <br>Anaximander thought the Earth was a cylinder, while Anaximenes (no relation) believed it was a flat rectangle floating on compressed air.<br> <br><br> <br>But by 500 BC or so, most people agreed with the philosophers Pythagoras and Aristotle: The Earth was round, like a ball. There was good evidence for this.<br> <br>If you really want to celebrate the discovery of round Earth, don&#x2019;t celebrate Columbus Day on October 12&#x2014;celebrate Eratosthenes (&#x201c;air-uh-TOSS-thuh-neez&#x201d;) Day on June 21! Eratosthenes was the Greek who invented the word &#x201c;geography&#x201d; and a very smart guy&#x2014;in fact, he was the head librarian at the ancient world&#x2019;s largest library, in Alexandria. Around 240 BC, Eratosthenes devised a very clever experiment to measure the Earth. In late June, on the longest day of the year, he had two sticks placed straight in the ground in two different cities, five hundred miles apart, and measured their shadows. The shadows were different lengths, which meant the sticks weren&#x2019;t parallel&#x2014;the Earth was round after all!<br> <br><br> <br>What&#x2019;s more, Eratosthenes could use the length of the shadow to calculate the size of the entire Earth, without ever leaving Egypt. His measurement was about 24,600 miles, and today we know that the Earth actually measures 24,902 miles around at the equator. Eratosthenes was off by just a few hundred miles!<br> The Accidental Tourist<p></p> <br>Columbus, however, didn&#x2019;t get the memo. For his 1492 voyage, he relied on maps made by Egyptian scientist Ptolemy (the P is silent, luckily, or his name would be a pterrible ptongue ptwister). Ptolemy&#x2019;s math led him to believe that Europe and Asia were quite a bit wider than they actually are, so Columbus thought he could circle the Earth in just 16,000 miles! The world&#x2019;s best navigators at the time were the Portuguese, and they knew this was crazy talk. Their own guess was close to Eratosthenes&#x2019;s: about 26,000 miles. Columbus set off anyway, sure that he could get all the way to China and India in a matter of weeks. Luckily, there was a big unknown continent in the way (Spoilers! It was North America!) or he would have been lost at sea forever. India was four times farther away than he thought, and he would have run out of supplies months before arriving.<br> <br><br> Doing Their Level Best<p></p> <br>Despite all the geographical evidence, there are people who still believe that the Earth is flat. The largest organization for these unscientific souls is the Flat Earth Society, founded by a British sign painter in 1956, the year before the space age began.<br> <br><br> <br>The Earth proposed by this group is a big, flat disk like Thales suggested, with the North Pole in the center. Antarctica is a big wall of ice around the edge, which luckily keeps the oceans from leaking off!<br> <br>The society&#x2019;s membership peaked at about two thousand in the 1970s, but today it&#x2019;s down to a few hundred true believers. Of course, it&#x2019;s a lot harder to believe in a flat Earth now that spaceships and satellites are orbiting the Earth and sending back pictures all the time. During the 1950s, the society&#x2019;s founder was given one of the first photos of a round Earth taken from space. &#x201c;It is easy to see how such a picture could fool the untrained eye,&#x201d; he calmly replied.<br> Let&#x2019;s Not Wait; It&#x2019;s a Really Long Line<p></p> <br>The grid of north&#x2013;south and east&#x2013;west lines that you see on maps is used to mark latitude and longitude. (IMPORTANT NOTE: These lines are imaginary! You will not see them by looking out the window of an airplane!) Latitude is a measurement of how far north or south you are, while longitude measures east and west.<br><br>Official Junior Genius Way to Remember Which Is Which<br> <br>&#x201c;Latitude&#x201d; lines go from side to side, like the rungs of a &#x201c;ladder.&#x201d; &#x201c;Longitude&#x201d; lines travel from the North to South Poles&#x2014;a really &#x201c;long&#x201d; way.<br> <br><br><br>If you were to stand at one of the poles, it would take the Earth&#x2019;s rotation a full day to turn you in a circle&#x2014;in other words, you&#x2019;d be moving veeeeery slowly. But at the equator, the surface of the Earth rotates a lot faster. Standing &#x201c;still&#x201d; at the equator, you&#x2019;re actually moving at 1,070 miles per hour, faster than the speed of sound!<br><br>Math Homework<br> <br>If you have an atlas (or GPS device) and a calculator with a cosine key, you can find out how fast you&#x2019;re spinning right now! Find your latitude in degrees, enter it into your calculator, and hit the COS button. Then multiply this answer by 1,070 miles per hour. Presto! That speed is your current velocity! Wow, you&#x2019;re getting a pretty good workout.<br><br>Pop Quiz!<br> <br>What country&#x2019;s name actually means &#x201c;equator&#x201d; in its native language?<br> <br><br> <br> Do You Come From a Land Down Under?<p></p> <br>South of the equator is the Southern Hemisphere. Of course, no one in the Southern Hemisphere ever &#x201c;falls off&#x201d; the Earth&#x2014;gravity keeps Australians and South Africans and Argentines firmly on the ground, just as it does for Americans and Europeans. But there are a few differences Down Under.<br> <br>Because the Southern Hemisphere is tipped toward the sun while the Northern Hemisphere is tipped away from it, their seasons are reversed: In the Southern Hemisphere summer starts in December, and August is the depth of winter.<br> <br><br> <br>So an Australian Christmas doesn&#x2019;t have sleigh rides and chestnuts roasting on an open fire&#x2014;it&#x2019;s more likely to involve a barbecue and a trip to the beach!<br> <br>The moon is upside down in the Southern Hemisphere too: The Man in the Moon&#x2019;s eyes are at the bottom, and a waning (shrinking) crescent looks like this.<br> <br><br> <br>One thing that&#x2019;s not different in the Southern Hemisphere: going to the bathroom! It&#x2019;s sometimes said that toilets flush counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern, but that&#x2019;s not true. There is a force called the Coriolis effect that makes big things, like weather systems, rotate differently in the two hemispheres, but a toilet is just too small to be affected.<br> East Is East and West Is West<p></p> <br>Latitude at sea is pretty easy. Since ancient times, sailors have known how to judge their latitude from the height of the sun at noon. All you need to know is the date.<br> <br>Longitude, however, was a lot harder. Today, we&#x2019;re used to having GPS devices in our cars and phones, so it&#x2019;s hard for us to understand that, just 250 years ago, there was no invention on Earth that could tell you how far west or east you were at any given time! Mostly, sailors had to guess about longitude and hope for the best.<br> <br>In 1717, a terrible shipwreck off the coast of England sank four ships and killed over fourteen hundred sailors, including the heroic British admiral of the fleet Sir Cloudesley Shovell.<br><br>Junior Genius Joviality!<br> <br>The next time you have a substitute teacher, make sure to tell the sub your name is Sir Cloudesley Shovell!<br><br>Shovell&#x2019;s fleet, it turned out, had run aground because they&#x2019;d calculated their longitude wrong. As a result of the disaster, the British government offered a �20,000 prize (over a million dollars in today&#x2019;s money!) to the first scientist who could solve the longitude problem. There were lots of theories. Galileo had tried to compute longitude by carefully studying the moons of Jupiter. Other scientists tried to do it by measuring the distance between the sun and the moon or looking for irregularities in the Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field.<br> <br><br> <br>The problem was finally solved with, of all things, a really good clock. Why a clock? Well, if you know what time the sun is supposed to set today back home in London, and you can tell what time the sun just set at your current location, then you know how far west or east of London you are. Unfortunately, good eighteenth-century clocks all used a swinging pendulum, which means they didn&#x2019;t keep reliable time when a ship was bouncing around on a stormy sea. A clock maker named John Harrison solved this problem by inventing a clock that could keep accurate time on the waves, and he collected a hefty prize and died a very wealthy man.<br> <br><br><br>Extra Credit<br> <br>Before an international conference decided that the &#x201c;zero&#x201d; line of latitude, the prime meridian, would run through Greenwich, England, many maps used a meridian through Paris. In 1994, the city of Paris marked that old meridian&#x2014;which still shows up on some French maps, even though everyone uses Greenwich today&#x2014;with a string of 135 bronze medallions set into the ground. Not to be outdone, the Greenwich observatory installed a green laser that projects the prime meridian into the London sky every night.<br> <br> Zoning Out<p></p> <br>In 1884, a Canadian engineer named Sandford Fleming proposed dividing the world into twenty-four standard time zones, more or less the system we have today. At the time, there was no such thing as &#x201c;standard time&#x201d; in most countries. Until the 1880s, the United States alone was divided into more than eight thousand time zones, with each town setting its own local time based on the position of the sun at noon. This worked fine until railroads started to cross the country, and at that point thousands of time zones made train schedules very confusing.<br> <br>The delegates at the conference decided not to institute Fleming&#x2019;s time zone system, leaving it up to individual countries. Over the next fifty years, pretty much the whole world adopted some kind of &#x201c;standard time&#x201d; based on Fleming&#x2019;s system, giving us the time zone map we have today.<br> <br><br> <br>You probably already know that when it&#x2019;s noon on Monday in Los Angeles, it&#x2019;s three in the afternoon in New York City. This continues across the globe: It&#x2019;s already eight o&#x2019;clock at night in London (so maybe the prime meridian laser just turned on at Greenwich). It&#x2019;s midnight in Moscow and 4 AM in China and western Australia&#x2014;in other words, it&#x2019;s already tomorrow! At some point in our eastward journey, we need to jump back from tomorrow to today. That jump happens at the international date line, the zigzaggy line up there through the Pacific. On the west side of that line, it&#x2019;s 6 AM Tuesday. An inch to the right, on the east side, it&#x2019;s 7 AM&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but on Monday.<br> <br>This may seem silly, but what&#x2019;s the alternative? To have it be the same time (say, 8 AM Monday) all over the world, even if the sun is setting in Cairo and it&#x2019;s pitch-black in Tokyo? I&#x2019;m sure you can agree, Junior Geniuses, that this would be even sillier.<br><br>Blast from the Past<br> <br>Because of time zones, it&#x2019;s quite possible to take off in an airplane and land at your destination at an earlier time than you left! Sportscaster Bob Costas likes to tell the story of traveling with a 1970s basketball team called the Spirits of St. Louis. The Spirits&#x2019; colorful star, Marvin &#x201c;Bad News&#x201d; Barnes, took a look at his itinerary at the airport one day and saw that his flight was leaving Louisville at 8 PM and arriving in St. Louis at 7:56 PM due to the change from eastern to central time. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t getting on no time machine!&#x201d; Barnes told Costas, and walked off to rent a car instead.<br><br><br> Summertime Blues<p></p> <br>The idea for daylight saving time was first dreamed up by Benjamin Franklin in 1784, but Americans didn&#x2019;t start setting their clocks forward every summer until World War I and World War II, when conserving daylight meant conserving precious fuel.<br> <br><br> <br>All that clock changing can cause confusion. Every autumn when clocks fall backward one hour, Amtrak trains find themselves an hour ahead of schedule midjourney, so they just stop on the tracks and chill for an hour! An even weirder case happened in a Cary, North Carolina, hospital in 2007, as Laura Cirioli gave birth to twins one November night. Her son, Peter, was born first, at 1:32 AM. But then the clocks moved back one hour to end daylight saving, and her second twin, Allison, was born thirty-four minutes later, at 1:06 AM. So she&#x2019;s technically twenty-six minutes older than her brother, who was born first!<br><br>Pop Quiz!<br> <br>What&#x2019;s the only state in the Lower 48 states that doesn&#x2019;t observe daylight saving time?<br> <br><br><br><br> The World&#x2019;s Five Most Confusing Time-Zone Tangles<p></p> <br><br> <br>NEPAL. Most of the Earth&#x2019;s many time zones differ from Greenwich time by a certain whole number of hours: Brazil is three hours earlier, Ethiopia is five hours later. A few places are offset by a half-hour difference. But Nepal, in the Himalayas, is the only country with a fifteen-minute difference! That&#x2019;s right: When it&#x2019;s ten in India, it&#x2019;s ten fifteen next door in Nepal! That&#x2019;s because Nepal still uses its most sacred mountain, Gauri Sankar, as its own private meridian instead of adopting India&#x2019;s standard time. Locals call the fifteen-minute gap &#x201c;Nepali stretched time&#x201d; and use it as an excuse to be a little late for appointments.<br> <br><br> <br>KIRIBATI AND SAMOA. For its first fifteen years of independence, the Pacific island nation of Kiribati straddled both sides of the international date line, so it was always two different days at the same time in Kiribati! In 1995, it moved its remote eastern islands into the same time zone as its western half. Coincidentally&#x2014;or not&#x2014;this change makes eastern Kiribati the first nation on Earth to celebrate the New Year every year. This was a big tourist draw when the new millennium dawned on December 31, 1999!<br> <br></p><h2>Windfallen</h2><p><p><em>From the #1 </em>New York Times<em> bestselling author of </em>Me Before You<em>, the basis for the major motion picture, comes a breathtaking drama of two women whose lives entwine through a lovely English seaside house.</em></p><p>For Lottie Swift, Arcadia has always been magical. The breathtaking art deco house perched above the shoreline of the well-ordered village of Merham seems to stand still throughout the years. It has never changed, not really, but Lottie's fate and fortune have been inextricably linked with that of the beautiful house, and it will forever be fixed in her mind as a symbol of adventure, youth, and of loves lost and gained. Even as her life&#x2014;and the house&#x2014;fall into disrepair.</p><p>Years later another young woman comes to Merham. A designer hired to make over the now-empty Arcadia, Daisy Parsons seeks a new beginning, as Lottie once did. Fleeing a broken relationship and now facing being a single mother, Daisy finds refuge in the house, and something more&#x2014;a love she thought she would never know again and a friendship unlike any she&#x2019;s experienced before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Jojo Moyes is a British novelist and journalist. She is one of only a few authors to have twice won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists' Association and has been translated into eleven different languages. </p>For more than 50 years, Arcadia, an art-deco house set precariously and imperiously atop Merham's seaside cliffs, has been simultaneously ruling and ruining Lottie's life. From the day she was first inexplicably drawn to it as a teenager, Lottie's fate and fortune have been inextricably linked with that of the compelling mansion. Once a retreat for bohemian artists and actors whose very presence threatened the rigid morality of this sleepy British village, Arcadia promises to once again become a haven for a new generation of undesirable visitors when it's transformed into a luxury hotel. Along with the Louis Vuitton travel cases, emotional baggage comes attached to the new venture, mostly in the form of its insecure interior designer, Daisy, who has been charged with returning the estate, and, she hopes, her love life to their original glory. When she discovers a neglected mural depicting scenes from Arcadia's scandalous past, Daisy unleashes a torrent of painful emotions that undermines the life Lottie has so painstakingly built. Intricately and intimately weaving the story of Lottie's tumultuous past with Daisy's tempestuous present, Moyes richly evokes a spellbinding intergenerational saga of loves lost and opportunities missed, of families in transition and friendships in turmoil. With accomplished polish and alluring perfection, Moyes' second novel is a stunning successor to her acclaimed debut, <i>Sheltering Rain</i> [BKL My 1 02], deservedly earning her a reputation as a first-rate storyteller in the best tradition of popular British fiction's reigning doyennes. <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Guess what I saw!"<br><br>McKinley had been sleeping in the front yard bushes. Hearing the familiar voice, he lifted his head and looked around with sleepy eyes. He was just in time to see Jack, his human pup, skid so fast on his mountain bike that gravel scattered everywhere. The boy leaped off the bike, raced across the place where the cars sat, and ran into the house.<br><br>Now what? McKinley wondered.<br><br>Though he would have liked to sleep more, McKinley stood, yawned, stretched his muscles until they were tight, then relaxed them until they were loose. Shaking his head, he jangled his collar tags, and then ambled toward the house.<br><br>By the time McKinley reached the door, it had already swung shut. As he had taught himself to do, he bent down, wedged a large forepaw where there was a gap beneath the door, extended his claws, and pushed. The door popped open a little.<br><br>Sticking his nose into the gap, McKinley shoved the door further open and squirmed inside. Once there, he sniffed. Smelling dinner, he trotted down the hallway, wagging his tail, till he heard Jack saying, "Dad, I'm not making it up, I really saw a wolf."<br><br>McKinley stopped short. His tail drooped. Was that the <i>wolf</i> word the boy had used?<br><br>When he was young -- Jack had also been much younger -- McKinley had spotted a wolf during a walk with his people. It was just a glimpse, but the people had seen it, too. They had become very excited, That's when McKinley learned the <i>wolf</i> word. He could recall the wolf's reek, a mix of deep woods, dark earth, and fresh meat. Its wildness had frightened him. And excited him. But that was a long time ago.<br><br>Wide awake now, McKinley hurried past the large room and into the small food place.<br><br>Jack was talking to the man of the family. Sometimes the man was called Dad, sometimes Gil. McKinley liked him and the way he always smelled of the outdoors.<br><br>"Now, hang on, Jack." the man said. "You sure it wasn't just a big old German shepherd? They can look a lot like a wolf."<br><br>McKinley stood still, his head cocked. There it was again, the <i>wolf</i> word.<br><br>"No way, Dad " the human pup answered. "You know how much I've read about wolves. I'm sure this was one. I mean, yeah, at first I thought it was McKinley. But it wasn't."<br><br>Wanting to understand more, McKinley jumped onto one of the sitting places near where the humans put their food when they ate. Mouth slightly open, tail wagging, he sat, turning from the pup to the man as each spoke.<br><br>"I'm not saying you're wrong," the man said. "Just, if you're right, it's pretty amazing. Hasn't been a wolf sighted around here for years. Remember the time we spotted one up in the Zirkel Wilderness? But not here in Steamboat Springs."<br><br>McKinley saw Jack look around. "Where's Mom?"<br><br>At the mention of Jack's female -- the boy called her Mom, the man called her Sarah -- McKinley barked once. The woman spent time on Most Cars Way in a place where there was lots of food, and often brought him treats -- like bones.<br><br>Gil said, "She has to work the dinner shift. So it'll be just you and me tonight. Sausages and carrots. And your mom made bread. Now keep talking as you set the table."<br><br>Jack A but threw down his eating sticks and tall, clear bowls as he chattered. I was a little scared," he was saying. "I mean, that wolf redly surprised me. I think I surprised him, too."<br><br>The human pup poured water for himself and the man into the tall bowls, then thumped down onto the sitting place. McKinley edged closer to the boy.<br><br>"Here's grub," "the man said as he brought food to the boy and sat across from him. "And I'm starving."<br><br>McKinley, eyeing the food, drooled and licked his own nose.<br><br>"I was marking trail up by Rabbit Ears Pass all day," the man said. "Fair amount of snow up there already. Promises a good season."<br><br>"Hear that, McKinley?" Jack cried. "Snow is coming!"<br><br><i>Snow,</i> a word McKinley knew and loved. He barked in appreciation.<br><br>"But go on," the man said to the pup. "Tell me exactly what you saw."<br><br>Jack spoke between mouthfuls. "See -- the wolf had this thick, gray fur coat -- with sort of flecks of gold. His head was wide -- his muzzle was light colored -- and I think he had a limp."<br><br>"Was he bigger than McKinley?"<br><br>Jack turned toward him. McKinley, wishing the human pup would calm down and speak slower, leaned over and licked his face.<br><br>"A lot skinnier," Jack said, wiping his cheek with the back of a hand. "Longer legs, too. Gray fur. Not blackish."<br><br>"You didn't see a collar, did you?"<br><br>"No way."<br><br>"Describe his eyes."<br><br>McKinley watched closely as Jack swallowed the last of the sausage. "Not, you know, brown and round like McKinley's. Like, sort of yellowish. And, you know, egg-shaped."<br><br>The man reached for his tall bowl and drank. Then he said, "Well, that's certainly wolflike. Where'd you see him?"<br><br>"Up in Strawberry Park."<br><br>McKinley yawned with nervousness. Strawberry Park was a small valley outside of Steamboat Springs. It was hemmed in by forested hills, and beyond, by snow-peaked mountains. Looming over everything was the great mountain, where most of the humans did their snow sliding.<br><br>There were only a few houses in the area, and the dogs who lived there ran completely free. McKinley was head dog there as well as in town.<br><br>"What were you doing there?" Gil asked.<br><br>Jack shrugged. "School was out. I was exploring."<br><br>"McKinley with you?"<br><br>Jack gave his dog a quick smile. "Wish he was."<br><br>Liking the attention, McKinley barked.<br><br>"Hey, how about feeding him his dinner?"<br><br>"McKinley, I'm sorry!"<br><br>The pup leaped up.<br><br>McKinley watched as jack snatched his food bowl from the floor, then reached into a food box. The boy put some bits into the bowl, added water, and set it back on the ground. As a final touch, he placed two dog biscuits on top.<br><br>McKinley wagged his tail, jumped off the sitting place, and went for the wet food, gulping down the biscuits first.<br><br>"Jack," Gil said, "if that was a wolf -- and I'm not saying it wasn't -- there are going to be lots of people in town stirred up. Generally speaking, folks don't like wolves."<br><br>McKinley stopped eating to look around. There it was again, the <i>wolf</i> word.<br><br>"I know, Dad," Jack said. "People say wolves are mean and vicious. They aren't. Look at McKinley."<br><br>"McKinley is a malamute," Gil said. "Not a wolf."<br><br>"Part wolf," Jack insisted.<br><br>"Well, maybe so, way back. Not now. Look Jack, the point is, this is still ranching country. If people learn there's a wolf nearby, some of them will be wanting to hunt it down. Kill it. I'm serious, Jack. Since you like wolves, be smart. Don't let anybody know what you saw"<br><br>The words <i>hunt</i> and <i>kill</i> unsettled McKinley. Hunting was not something that Jack's family did. But there were many humans in town -- and their dogs -- who hunted. For McKinley it meant <i>danger.</i> just the sense of it made him bark.<br><br>Jack and Gil turned to look at him.<br><br>Gil asked, "What do you think he's saying?"<br><br>"Wish I knew," Jack said.<br><br>First Aladdin Paperbacks edition April 2003<br><br>Text copyright � 2001 by Avi</p><h2>Golden Hill: A Novel of Old New York</h2><p><b>A <i>Wall Street Journal </i>Top Ten Fiction Book of 2017 * A <i>Washington Post</i> Notable Fiction Book of the Year * A <i>Seattle Times </i>Favorite Book of 2017 * An NPR Best Book of 2017 * A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Historical Fiction Book of the Year * A <i>Library Journal</i> Top Historical Fiction Book of the Year * Winner of the Costa First Novel Award, the RSL Ondaatje Prize, and the Desmond Elliott Prize * Winner of the New York City Book Award</b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;Gorgeously crafted...Spufford's sprawling recreation here is pitch perfect.&#x201d; &#x2014;Maureen Corrigan, <i>Fresh Air</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;A fast-paced romp that keeps its eyes on the moral conundrums of America.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;Delirious storytelling backfilled with this much intelligence is a rare and happy sight.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;<i>Golden Hill</i> possesses a fluency and immediacy, a feast of the senses...I love this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> <br> <b>The spectacular first novel from acclaimed nonfiction author Francis Spufford follows the adventures of a mysterious young man in mid-eighteenth century Manhattan, thirty years before the American Revolution.</b><br><br>New York, a small town on the tip of Manhattan island, 1746. One rainy evening in November, a handsome young stranger fresh off the boat arrives at a countinghouse door on Golden Hill Street: this is Mr. Smith, amiable, charming, yet strangely determined to keep suspicion shimmering. For in his pocket, he has what seems to be an order for a thousand pounds, a huge sum, and he won&#x2019;t explain why, or where he comes from, or what he is planning to do in the colonies that requires so much money.

His first book, <i>I May Be Some Time</i>, won the Writers&#x2019; Guild Award for Best Nonfiction Book of 1996, the Banff Mountain Book Prize, and a Somerset Maugham Award. It was followed by <i>The Child That Books Built</i>, <i>Backroom Boys</i>, <i>Red Plenty </i>(which was translated into nine languages), and most recently, <i>Unapologetic</i>.

II<p></p> 1746<p></p> I<p></p> <br>The brig Henrietta having made Sandy Hook a little before the dinner hour&#x2014;and having passed the Narrows about three o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;and then crawling to and fro, in a series of tacks infinitesimal enough to rival the calculus, across the grey sheet of the harbour of New-York&#x2014;until it seemed to Mr. Smith, dancing from foot to foot upon deck, that the small mound of the city waiting there would hover ahead in the November gloom in perpetuity, never growing closer, to the smirk of Greek Zeno&#x2014;and the day being advanced to dusk by the time Henrietta at last lay anchored off Tietjes Slip, with the veritable gables of the city&#x2019;s veritable houses divided from him only by one hundred foot of water&#x2014;and the dusk moreover being as cold and damp and dim as November can afford, as if all the world were a quarto of grey paper dampened by drizzle until in danger of crumbling imminently to pap:&#x2014;all this being true, the master of the brig pressed upon him the virtue of sleeping this one further night aboard, and pursuing his shore business in the morning. (He meaning by the offer to signal his esteem, having found Mr. Smith a pleasant companion during the slow weeks of the crossing.) But Smith would not have it. Smith, bowing and smiling, desired nothing but to be rowed to the dock. Smith, indeed, when once he had his shoes flat on the cobbles, took off at such speed despite the gambolling of his land-legs that he far out-paced the sailor dispatched to carry his trunk&#x2014;and must double back for it, and seizing it hoist it instanter on his own shoulder&#x2014;and gallop on, skidding over fish-guts and turnip leaves and cats&#x2019; entrails, and the other effluvium of the port&#x2014;asking for direction here, asking again there&#x2014;so that he appeared most nearly as a type of smiling whirlwind when he shouldered open the door&#x2014;just as it was about to be bolted for the evening&#x2014;of the counting-house of the firm of Lovell &amp; Company, on Golden Hill Street, and laid down his burden while the prentices were lighting the lamps, and the clock on the wall showed one minute to five, and demanded, very civilly, speech that moment with Mr. Lovell himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Lovell,&#x201d; said the merchant, rising from his place by the fire. His qualities in brief, to meet the needs of a first encounter: fifty years old; a spare body but a pouched and lumpish face, as if Nature had set to work upon the clay with knuckles; shrewd and anxious eyes; brown small-clothes; a bob-wig yellowed by tobacco smoke. &#x201c;Help ye?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good day,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, &#x201c;for I am certain it is a good day, never mind the rain and the wind. And the darkness. You&#x2019;ll forgive the dizziness of the traveller, sir. I have the honour to present a bill drawn upon you by your London correspondents, Messrs. Banyard and Hythe. And request the favour of its swift acceptance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Could it not have waited for the morrow?&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;Our hours for public business are over. Come back and replenish your purse at nine o&#x2019;clock. Though for any amount over ten pound sterling I&#x2019;ll ask you to wait out the week, cash money being scarce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;It is for a greater amount. A far greater. And I am come to you now, hot-foot from the cold sea, salt still on me, dirty as a dog fresh from a duck-pond, not for payment, but to do you the courtesy of long notice.&#x201d;<br> <br>And he handed across a portfolio, which being opened revealed a paper cover clearly sealed in black wax with a B and an H. Lovell cracked it, his eyebrows already half-raised. He read, and they rose further.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lord love us,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is a bill for a thousand pound.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;A thousand pounds sterling; or as it says there, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight pounds, fifteen shillings and fourpence, New-York money. May I sit down?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell ignored him. &#x201c;Jem,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;fetch a lantern closer.&#x201d;<br> <br>The clerk brought one of the fresh-lit candles in its chimney, and Lovell held the page up close to the hot glass; so close that Smith made a start as if to snatch it away, which Lovell reproved with an out-thrust arm; but he did not scorch the paper, only tilted it where the flame shone through and showed in paler lines the watermark of a mermaid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Paper&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said the clerk.<br> <br>&#x201c;The hand too,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;Benjamin Banyard&#x2019;s own, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, &#x201c;though his name was Barnaby Banyard when he sat in his office in Mincing Lane and wrote the bill for me. Come, now, gentlemen; do you think I found this on a street-corner?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell surveyed him, clothes and hands and visage and speech, such as he had heard of it, and found nothing there that closed the question.<br> <br>&#x201c;You might ha&#x2019; done,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;for all I know. For I don&#x2019;t know you. What is this thing? And who are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What it seems to be. What I seem to be. A paper worth a thousand pounds; and a traveller who owns it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or a paper fit to wipe my arse, and a lying rogue. Ye&#x2019;ll have to do better than that. I&#x2019;ve done business with Banyard&#x2019;s for twenty year, and settled with &#x2019;em for twenty year with bills on Kingston from my sugar traffic. Never this; never paper sent all on a sudden this side the water, asking money paid for the whole season&#x2019;s account, almost, without a word, or a warning, or a by-your-leave. I&#x2019;ll ask again: who are you? What&#x2019;s your business?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well: in general, Mr. Lovell, buying and selling. Going up and down in the world. Seeing what may turn to advantage; for which my thousand pounds may be requisite. But more specifically, Mr. Lovell: the kind I choose not to share. The confidential kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You impudent pup, flirting your mangled scripture at me! Speak plain, or your precious paper goes in the fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; said Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, won&#x2019;t I? You jumped enough a moment gone when I had it nigh the lamp. Speak, or it burns.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And your good name with it. Mr. Lovell, this is the plain kernel of the matter: I asked at the Exchange for London merchants in good standing, joined to solid traders here, and your name rose up with Banyard&#x2019;s, as an honourable pair, and they wrote the bill.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They never did before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They have done now. And assured me you were good for it. Which I was glad to hear, for I paid cash down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cash down,&#x201d; repeated Lovell, flatly. He read out: &#x201c; &#x2018;At sixty days&#x2019; sight, pay this our second bill to Mr. Richard Smith, for value received&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019; You say you paid in coin, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of your own, or of another&#x2019;s? As agent, or principal? To settle a score or to write a new one? To lay out in investments, or to piss away on furbelows and sateen weskits?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just in coin, sir. Which spoke for itself, eloquently.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You not finding it convenient, no doubt, to move so great a weight of gold across the ocean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or else hoping to find a booby on the other side as&#x2019;d turn paper to gold for the asking.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I never heard that New-Yorkers were so easy to impose on,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;So we aren&#x2019;t, sir,&#x201d; said Lovell, &#x201c;so we aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He drummed his fingers. &#x201c;Especially when one won&#x2019;t take the straight way to clear off the suspicion we may be gulled. &#x2014;You&#x2019;ll excuse my manner. I speak as I find, usually; but I don&#x2019;t know how I find you, I don&#x2019;t know how to take you, and you study to keep me uncertain, which I don&#x2019;t see as a kindness, or as especial candid, I must say, in a strip of a boy who comes demanding payment of an awk&#x2019;ard-sized fortune, on no surety.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On all the ordinary surety of a right bill,&#x201d; protested Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;There you go,&#x201d; Lovell said. &#x201c;Smiling again. Commerce is trust, sir. Commerce is need and need together, sir. Commerce is putting a hand in answer into a hand out-stretched; but when I call you a rogue, you don&#x2019;t flare up, as is the natural answer at the mere accusation, and call me a rogue for doubting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; returned Smith cheerfully. &#x201c;For you&#x2019;re right, of course. You don&#x2019;t know me; and suspicion must be your wisest course, when I may be equally a gilded sprig of the bon ton, or a flash cully working the inkhorn lay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell blinked. Smith&#x2019;s voice had darkened to a rookery croak, and there was no telling if he was putting on or taking off a mask.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s the lovely power of being a stranger,&#x201d; Smith went on, as pleasant as before. &#x201c;I may as well have been born again when I stepped ashore. You&#x2019;ve a new man before you, new-made. I&#x2019;ve no history here, and no character: and what I am is all in what I will be. But the bill, sir, is a true one. How may I set your mind at rest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve the oddest notion in the world of reassurance, if you&#x2019;re in earnest,&#x201d; said Lovell, staring. &#x201c;You could tell me why I&#x2019;ve had no letter, to cushion this surprise. I&#x2019;d have expected an explanation, a warning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps I out-paced it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps. But I believe I&#x2019;ll keep my counsel till I see more than perhaps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;Nothing more natural, when I may be a rascal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Again, you make mighty free with that possibility,&#x201d; Lovell said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I only name the difficulty you&#x2019;re under. Would you trust me more if we pretended some other thing were at issue?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I might,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;I might well. An honest man would surely labour to keep off the taint of such a thing. You seem to be inviting it, Mr. Smith. Yet I can&#x2019;t be so casual, can I? My name&#x2019;s my credit. Do you know what will happen if I accept your bill, for your secret business, your closed-mouth business, your smiling business, your confidential business? And you discount it with some good neighbour of mine, to lay your hands on the money as fast as may be, as I&#x2019;ve no doubt you mean to? Then there&#x2019;ll be sixty-day paper with my name upon&#x2019;t, going round and round the island, playing the devil with my credit just at the turn of the season, in no kind of confidence at all. All will know it; all will know I&#x2019;m to be dunned for a thousand pound, and wonder should they try to mulct me first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I won&#x2019;t discount it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t discount it. I can wait. There is no hurry. I have no pressing need for funds; sixty days&#x2019; sight, it says, and sixty days will suit me perfectly. Keep the bill; keep it under your eye; save it from wandering.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I accept it, you mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. If you accept it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you protest it, I shall make this the shortest landing in the colonies that ever was heard of. I shall walk back along the quay, and when the Henrietta is loaded, I shall ship home, and lodge my claim for damages with Banyard&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t protest it,&#x201d; said Lovell, slowly. &#x201c;Neither yet do I accept it. It says here, our second bill, and I&#x2019;ve not seen hide or hair of first nor third. What ships d&#x2019;ye say they&#x2019;re bound on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sansom&#x2019;s Venture and Antelope,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Lovell, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll do. We&#x2019;ll wait and we&#x2019;ll see; and if the others of the set turn up, why then I&#x2019;ll say I accepted the bill today, and you shall have your sixty days, and if you&#x2019;re lucky you may be paid by quarter-day; and if they don&#x2019;t appear, why then you&#x2019;re the rascal you tease at being, and I&#x2019;ll have you before the justices for personation. What do you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s irregular,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, &#x201c;but something should be allowed for teasing. Very well: done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Done,&#x201d; echoed Lovell. &#x201c;Jem, note and date the document, will you? And add a memorandum of this agreement; and make another note that we&#x2019;re to write to Banyard&#x2019;s on our own account, by the first vessel, asking explanations. And then let&#x2019;s have it in the strongbox, to show in evidence, as I suspect, for the assizes. Now, sir, I believe I&#x2019;ll bid you&#x2014;&#x201d; Lovell checked himself, for Smith was feeling through the pockets of his coat. &#x201c;Was there something else?&#x201d; he asked heavily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Smith, bringing forth a purse. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told I should break my guineas to smaller change. Could you furnish me the value of these in pieces convenient for the city?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell looked at the four golden heads of the King glittering in Smith&#x2019;s palm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are they brass?&#x201d; said one of the prentices, grinning.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re not brass,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;Use your eyes, and not your mouth. Why ever&#x2014;?&#x201d; he said to Smith. &#x201c;Never mind. Never mind. Yes, I believe we can oblige you. Jem, get out the pennyweights, and check these.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Full weight,&#x201d; the clerk reported.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thought so,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;I am learning your humours, Mr. Smith. Well, now, let&#x2019;s see. We don&#x2019;t get much London gold, the flow being, as you might say, all the other way; it&#x2019;s moidores, and half-joes, mostly, when the yellow lady shows her face. So I believe I could offer you a hundred and eighty per centum on face, in New-York money. Which, for four guineas, would come to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One hundred and fifty one shillings, twopence-halfpenny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a calculator, are you? A sharp reckoner. Now I&#x2019;m afraid you can have only a little of it in coin; the reason being, as I said when first we began, that little coin is current at the present.&#x201d; Lovell opened a box with a key from his fob chain and dredged up silver&#x2014;worn silver, silver knocked and clatter&#x2019;d in the battles of circulation&#x2014;which he built into a little stack in front of Smith. &#x201c;A Mexica dollar, which we pass at eight-and-fourpence.

Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus. Could there be any truth to the increasingly disturbing rumors that he had a secret life?<br></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, March 1999:</b> With five novels to her credit, including the acclaimed <i>The Weight of Water</i>, Anita Shreve now offers a skillfully crafted exploration of the long reach of tragedy in <i>The Pilot's Wife</i>. News of Jack Lyons's fatal crash sends his wife into shock and emotional numbness: <blockquote> Kathryn wished she could manage a coma. Instead, it seemed that quite the opposite had happened: She felt herself to be inside of a private weather system, one in which she was continuously tossed and buffeted by bits of news and information, sometimes chilled by thoughts of what lay immediately ahead, thawed by the kindness of others ... frequently drenched by memories that seemed to have no regard for circumstance or place, and then subjected to the nearly intolerable heat of reporters, photographers and curious on-lookers. It was a weather system with no logic, she had decided, no pattern, no progression, no form. </blockquote> The situation becomes even more dire when the plane's black box is recovered, pinning responsibility for the crash on Jack. In an attempt to clear his name, Kathryn searches for any and all clues to the hours before the flight. Yet each discovery forces her to realize that she didn't know her husband of 16 years at all. Shreve's complex and highly convincing treatment of Kathryn's dilemma, coupled with intriguing minor characters and an expertly paced plot, makes <i>The Pilot's Wife</i> really take off.Praise for Anita Shreve's The Pilot's Wife <p>"Gripping. . . .

She accumulates the details gradually and quietly, bringing to life the grief-stricken Kathryn and Mattie with fascinating exactitude." --Jelena Petrovic, Minneapolis Star Tribune </p><p>"Shreve weaves a narrative that is part detective story and part interior monologue. . . . A thoughtful, often poignant novel." --Boston Magazine </p><p>"Oddly gripping." --Susan Salter Reynolds, Los Angeles Times Book Review </p><p>"The humanness of this novel, along with its attention to detail, makes this a provocative read. . . . While the story physically takes place in Ely, N.H., and extends to England and Ireland, there is much more exploration of a changing interior topogrpahy: the plateaus of normalcy, the valleys of sorrow, the vistas of strength. It is a story of a struggle to become self-reliant." --Angela Glaser, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel </p><p>"From cover to rapidly reached cover, The Pilot's Wife is beautifully plotted, tensely paced, and thoroughly absorbing." --Heller McAlpin, New York Newsday</p></p><h2>Texas Birds: A Folding Pocket Guide to Familiar Species (Wildlife and Nature Identification)</h2><p>The first state in the nation to create birding trails, Texas is the permanent or temporary home of 638 species of birds, including the state bird, the mockingbird.

He lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife and their two sons.The First Principle<br> &nbsp;<br> Objects are opportunities.<br> &nbsp;<br> The greatest misadventure ever involving alcohol and a nontraditional motor vehicle belongs to country-music legend George Jones: When his wife hid his car keys so he wouldn&#x2019;t drive to the liquor store, he made the eight-mile trip on a John Deere lawnmower. Bill Murray, however, gave the singer a run for his money in August 2007, when he went to the Scandinavian Masters, a golf tournament in Sweden. Late enough on a Sunday night that it was actually Monday morning&#x2014;around 3:30 A.M.&#x2014;Murray was spotted in downtown Stockholm, driving a golf cart through the streets. This was a sufficiently unusual mode of transportation that he got stopped by the police on suspicion of drunken driving. (Even if he had wanted to outrun them, he was in a golf cart.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Apparently the golf cart had been on display all week outside Bill&#x2019;s hotel&#x2014;until Bill and some friends commandeered it for a party at the Caf� Opera nightclub, about a mile away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Caf� Opera manager, Daniel Bodahl, said Bill &#x201c;was a very good guest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man in charge of the Scandinavian Masters, Fredrik Nilsmark, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t hold any grudge against Bill Murray for borrowing our cart for a while.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Detective-Inspector Christer Holmlund of the Stockholm police force said, &#x201c;I have done this since &#x2019;68 and I&#x2019;ve never experienced anything like this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bill&#x2019;s explanation? He hadn&#x2019;t personally borrowed the golf cart, he claimed&#x2014;he had started off as a passenger, being driven to a party. (Which sidestepped the question of whether the people driving him had permission to use that golf cart.) &#x201c;I was taken to the party by people who did not feel they could drive the golf cart back,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;They said, &#x2018;We can&#x2019;t drive back&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll lose our license.&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t lose my license.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s what America used to be famous for: helping out, pitching in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So he drove the golf cart through the streets of Stockholm sometime after 3:00 A.M. A &#x201c;twilight drive,&#x201d; Bill joked&#x2014;being so far north, Stockholm has incredibly long days during the summer. He had about six passengers crammed into the back of the cart and he was dropping them off at various destinations, like a bus driver. To complete the surreal scene, two drunk Swedish guys were hanging on to the very back of the cart, singing the 1970 Cat Stevens song &#x201c;Father and Son.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The last two people on the cart wanted to be dropped off at a 7-Eleven. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know they had 7-Elevens in Stockholm,&#x201d; Bill commented. In front of the 7-Eleven, the police spotted Bill behind the wheel of the golf cart and called him over, assuming that he must be drunk. Bill&#x2019;s explanation that he was a golfer proved insufficient.<br> &nbsp;<br> Holmlund said that when the police officer smelled alcohol, Bill declined to take a Breathalyzer test, &#x201c;citing American legislation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Or as Bill told the story, he told the police officer, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but where I come from, you have to act stupid or goofy or hit something or drive erratically or something&#x2014;you&#x2019;re just assuming that I&#x2019;m drunk because I&#x2019;m driving a golf cart at three-thirty in the morning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Holmlund agreed that Bill wasn&#x2019;t visibly drunk: &#x201c;There were no obvious signs, like when someone is really tipsy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The confrontation migrated to the police station. &#x201c;They said, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re going to take your blood now,&#x2019; and I said, &#x2018;What if I politely decline?&#x2019; &#x201d; Then, Bill said, &#x201c;They introduced me to this guy, Gunther or somebody...who had a smile on his face, but not the smile you want to see.&#x201d; Bill submitted to Gunther and the police administered a blood test; Bill signed a document conceding that he had been driving under the influence and authorizing a police officer to plead guilty on his behalf if the matter ever came before a judge. Bill was then released and allowed to leave Sweden.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the blood work ultimately came back, Bill&#x2019;s blood alcohol content was around 0.03 percent&#x2014;way below the general American DUI standard of 0.08 percent but above the strict Swedish threshold of 0.02 percent. He had to pay a fine. &#x201c;For having any amount of alcohol and having a golf cart, you have to pay something,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a courtesy, I guess.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Producer Joyce Sloane founded the Second City Touring Company, where the junior performers of Second City would take the group&#x2019;s Chicago-tested material on the road, with everyone piling into a van. She said that in the early seventies, after the tour hit Notre Dame, one of their performers disappeared for about a week&#x2014;apparently, Bill Murray had discovered that Saint Mary&#x2019;s College, a women&#x2019;s-only college, was next door. Even when Bill stayed with the group, he was a force of chaos.<br> &nbsp;<br> The troupe did a show at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which went extremely well: They were even invited to a reception at the president&#x2019;s home. But as the van pulled away and headed out of town, the entire cast had the giggles. Soon enough, Sloane figured out why: &#x201c;Bill had taken it upon himself to take the Oriental rug from the president&#x2019;s home and put it in the back of the van.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dan Patrick, revered sportscaster on ESPN and other venues, tells this story:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>We were doing a pub crawl in New York, an A-to-Z pub crawl. I run into Bill Murray at a place in the Village, and I said, &#x201c;Billy, we&#x2019;re going to go on a pub crawl and do you want to go with us?&#x201d;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>He said, &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; So we&#x2019;re walking down the street, there&#x2019;s Antique Boutique, and he goes, &#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d; He runs in and comes out with an orange tie.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>I said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this for?&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>He says, &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you say on </i>SportsCenter<i> that the hardest thing about being the coach of Tennessee is trying to find those god-awful orange ties?&#x201d; He said, &#x201c;Put it&nbsp;on!&#x201d;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>I put it on, we went on the A-to-Z pub crawl, we got to the letter L...and there&#x2019;s a street cleaner, the street sweeper; the machine is on.

I&#x2019;ll lose my job!&#x201d;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>And he sees it&#x2019;s Bill and I think Bill said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d; He said, &#x201c;Can I just take it down the street a little bit?&#x201d; So we just inched along like a tank down the street.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Lorne Michaels, creator and executive producer of Saturday Night Live, analyzed Bill Murray&#x2019;s location in the comedy firmament: &#x201c;So much of my generation&#x2019;s approach to comedy was a reaction against the neediness of performers. When Bill was onstage, he didn&#x2019;t much care whether they liked him. Because of that, he had enormous integrity.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michaels discovered, however, that integrity wasn&#x2019;t the same thing as reliability. In the summer of 1979, Michaels needed to get his Volkswagen Super Beetle from Los Angeles to New York; the producer had left it behind when he relocated to Manhattan for SNL. Bill volunteered to drive the car across the country&#x2014;and he did, but on his own timetable. &#x201c;Remember, I was his boss,&#x201d; Michaels said. &#x201c;Occasionally I would hear from Bill on the road. He&#x2019;d be in Florida, and I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;But, Bill&#x2014;is Florida on the way?&#x2019; Or a week later, he&#x2019;d be in Aspen and I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;But, Bill...&#x2019; &#x201d; Bill may not have treated the driving mission with the focus Michaels expected, but he did ultimately deliver the car, and with a bonus. The car arrived weeks late, and had accumulated hundreds of unexpected miles on the odometer&#x2014;but Bill had installed a top-notch stereo.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1985, Trine Licht was a young Danish woman living in New York City, delighted to have gotten a job as an assistant at Punch Productions, Dustin Hoffman&#x2019;s personal production company. She worked in the Directors&#x2019; Guild building, on 57th Street, helping to find novels and screenplays that Hoffman might want to star in or direct. After she had been on the job for a few months, she had a surprise visitor in her office: Bill Murray poked his head in and said hello. (Hoffman and Murray were friendly, having recently played roommates in Tootsie.) Bill became a semi-regular visitor. Licht said, &#x201c;He had an office down the hall but was not always there, only between shooting films. I think he read screenplays and novels there; maybe he did other things too. But he did occasionally ask, &#x2018;Have you read this&#x2019; or &#x2018;Have you read that,&#x2019; and he always looked like he was reading.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> One summer day, Bill dropped by Licht&#x2019;s office, as was his custom&#x2014;only this time, he asked, &#x201c;Want some popcorn?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When she said that she did, Bill disappeared. He was gone for long enough that Licht assumed he had forgotten about the popcorn. But when he came back, he didn&#x2019;t just have a bucket of popcorn: He pulled a cart full of warm popcorn into the office. Bill had gone down to the street, negotiated with a popcorn vendor, and bought his whole operation.</p><h2>The Pashto Dictionary: A Concise English-Pashto Dictionary</h2><p>If you&#39;re looking for a reliable modern Pashto-English dictionary, you&#39;re in the right place.

A conversation taking place in the spiritual realm. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were part of it. Throughout the history of humanity others have joined it, and there is something buried in each of our hearts that tells us we were created to be part of it as well. &nbsp; We long for it. We yearn to be in on it. But despite giving our lives to Christ and being born again in the Spirit, we don&#x2019;t always know how to plug into it. So we stay in earth&#x2019;s chat rooms rather than praying from heaven&#x2019;s throne room. Even Jesus&#x2019; disciples did not ask Him how to preach, but how to pray. &nbsp; <i>The Prayer Warrior&#x2019;s Way</i> is a practical guide for praying, enabling you to become versed in the basics necessary for talking to and hearing from God for yourself. Following the revolutionary prayer model Jesus gave to His disciples, Cindy Trimm gives you the keys to joining the most important conversation in the universe. <p> &nbsp;</p> <br></p><p><p></p><b>Cindy Trimm</b> has dedicated her life to serving God and humanity.

But Flicka comes from a long line of wild horses, and taming her will take more than Ken could ever have imagined. Soon, Ken is faced with an impossible choice: give up on his beautiful horse, or risk his life to fight for her.</p></p><p><p>Mary O&#x2019;Hara was born on July 10, 1885, in Cape May Point, New Jersey. She was a screenwriter during the silent film era and wrote several novels, including the range country trilogy <em>My Friend Flicka, Thunderhead,</em> and <em>Green Grass of Wyoming</em>. She also authored a novella, <em>The Catch Colt</em>, and <em>Wyoming Summer</em>, based on her diary of sixteen years. She died on October 14, 1980.</p>This classic story about a boy and his horse still stands strong. It's more an inspiring account of growing up and gaining self-assurance than it is a horse story. Wells is a surprising choice for narrating this book. His voice is urban and sophisticated, with no hint of soft edges that might be more suitable for a novel set in a simpler time in the American West. Fortunately, Wells deftly handles the life lessons discovered by 9-year-old Ken. Through Wells's voice we sense the vast gap between Ken's gentle mother and his demanding father, and what each parent brings to the son.

She woke up to a brilliant light at the foot of her bed. It was a tall, pulsating column of white fire. "That's the Presence of God," she said to herself. It filled her with a feeling of calm and comfort. She knew that it would see her safely through the birth and watch over her child. That Presence of God, sometimes called the Higher Self, did keep watch over me, through major and minor childhood mishaps and serious adult challenges. And it has also been my unfailing source of love, guidance, inspiration and limitless spiritual energy. I never know when my Higher Self is going to step in and make a difference in my life. For example, one fine spring day when I was at Boston University, I was hurrying out the door of my dorm when I heard an inner voice say, "Put on your heavy winter coat." I knew which coat. It was thick and lined with fake alpaca fur. I thought to myself, "OK, this is the craziest thing I've ever heard of, but I'll put it on." But my Higher Self wasn't satisfied. "Put on your heavy gloves," said the voice. "This is not for real," I said to myself. "I'll put on the coat, but I am not going to put on these heavy gloves. It's just too hot!" So I put on the coat and ran down the street, nearly late for my class. I crossed a street between some cars that were stopped at a light--and bam! A bicycle came speeding alongside one of the cars and ran right into me. It knocked me to the ground and I caught myself on my unprotected hands. I landed in a jumble, with my body insulated by the coat but my hands scraped up. My Higher Self had saved me from serious injury, but it couldn't save me from my own stubbornness. The lesson I learned that day is that being in touch with my Higher Self is more valuable than anything else in my life. The idea that each of us has a personalized Presence of God with us, is not new. Throughout history people have seen the Presence of God. They describe it as light, power and glory. It is the star that the wise men saw as they searched for the child Jesus. It is the pillar of fire that guided the children of Israel through the desert and the glory of God that appeared to Moses, the prophets and the Jewish mystics. It is the Body of Truth that Buddhists call the "ultimate dimension." The Tibetan Book of the Dead tells us that this Body of Truth appears to people after death as a "vast mass of light." It is also an important part of Western spirituality. My mother had learned about it from the writings of Guy W. Ballard, whose "I AM" Discourses she kept on her nightstand. He writes of the I AM Presence as the source of all power, knowledge and love. My mother had also read the works of Helena Blavatsky, who founded the Theosophical Society in the nineteenth century. Blavatsky describes a "Spiritual-Divine Monad" as the source of life substance. Ralph Waldo Emerson writes of the "Over-Soul" as the principle that gives life to our bodies. He calls it a light that "shines through us upon things," the source of genius, virtue, love, "all wisdom and all good." When you feel at one with this Presence, you feel at one with all of life. The American mystic Howard Thurman wrote that at times he felt at one with a "presence" when he was fishing in a rowboat on the river near his home in Florida. "There were times when it seemed as if the earth and the river and the sky and I were one beat of the same pulse....There would come a moment when beyond the single pulse beat there was a sense of Presence which seemed always to speak to me....[Yet] there was no voice. There was no image. There was no vision. There was God." In the following pages, you will read about specific techniques to bring you into a state of oneness with that Presence, your I AM Presence. This is a state of knowing, of belonging, of remembering. You can use these techniques no matter what your religious background or practice. When you are in tune with the Presence, you will draw to yourself everything you need--from food and clothing to new friends and brilliant ideas. Even better, you will learn to enter that state of oneness at will and experience the joy, peace and empowerment that are your birthright as a son or daughter of God. <p>Elizabeth Clare Prophet</p></p><h2>Zipping, Zapping, Zooming Bats (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)</h2><p>Bats fly into the spotlight in this exploration of such basics as where the live, how mothers raise their pups, and how they hunt for food.

From the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out series, this book aims to decrease children's fear of bats by increasing their knowledge and appreciation of the little brown bat, the most common in the U.S. The cogent text talks about bats' wing structure, claws, echolocation, grooming, hibernation, nursing, loss of habitat, and endangerment. Introducing bats as insect eaters, Earle puts their prodigious appetites in terms that children will understand: "Each night a bat chomps half its own weight in bugs. If you weigh 60 pounds, that's like eating 125 peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches every day." The book ends with fast facts on a few other bat species and simple plans for building bat houses. The artwork, combining acrylic paints and colored pencils, includes appealing full-page and double-page illustrations of bats as well as of children watching them. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Marx: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Karl Marx is one of the most influential philosophers of all time, whose theories have shaped and directed political, economic, and social thought for 150 years. Considering Marx's life and impact, renowned philosopher Peter Singer identifies the central vision that unifies Marx's thought, enabling us to grasp Marx's views as a whole. Presenting Marx as a philosopher primarily concerned with human freedom, rather than as an economist or a social scientist, Singer explains Marx's key ideas on alienation, historical materialism, and the economic theory of Capital, in plain English.<br><br>In this new edition, Singer explores whether Marx remains relevant to the twenty-first century, and if so, how. Does the fact that eight billionaires now own as much as the bottom half of the world's population give support to Marxist thinking? Does the ease with which conservative politicians can win over working class voters by appealing to nationalism undermines Marx's view of class struggle and the inevitability of victory for the proletariat? Singer ponders key questions such as these, and also discusses the place of the internet as a "productive force" when analyzed in Marxist theory. He concludes with an assessment of Marx's legacy, asking if there is any realistic prospect of replacing capitalism with a better system of production and distribution in the twenty-first century.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

However, sometimes a baby's true state falls a little off kilter and needs help to rebalance. Since babies do not come with instruction manuals, I teach parents and caregivers simple yoga-based movements and techniques to help free babies from suffering from digestion troubles and liberate their restlessness into peaceful sleep and happiness. You, as the caregiver, don't need any yoga experience to calm your baby and help him or her grow strong. All you need to do is breathe, love, and move! </p><p> <b></b></p><b>What Is Yoga?</b> <p> The word <i>yoga</i> has acquired many translations over the centuries. According to <i>The Heart of Yoga,</i> by T. K. V. Desikachar, meanings of the word include "to unite," "to come together," "to tie the strands of the mind together," and "acting in such a way that all of our attention is directed toward the activity in which we are currently engaged." Yoga gives us insight. The practice of yoga with a baby can help parents and caregivers bond with the baby more deeply, and understand how best to care for them. When parents come to my yoga studio, they are not distracted by the outside world. Yoga can bring moms and dads closer to understanding and supporting their child's intentions, needs, and desires. Through yoga, babies sense their parents' trust and deep commitment to understanding and responsiveness as they move forward in developing their physical, social, intellectual, and emotional skills in the way that is aligned with each child's highest destiny. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>What Is Itsy Bitsy Yoga�?</b> <p> Itsy Bitsy Yoga is a unique blend of yoga postures, infant developmental movement, and parent/child bonding. In this book, you will find nearly seventy easy-to-learn and practical poses and techniques that benefit your child from birth to twenty-four months old. I have intertwined the cross-cultural jewels from the wisdom of an infant's moving body, yoga, and the latest research in the field of infant development to deliver a developmentally nutritious movement program for a parent and baby to enjoy together. </p><p> In teaching yoga to facilitators and thousands of babies, toddlers, and parents, I have seen firsthand the benefits of yoga for babies: better sleep, improved digestion, relief from gas pains and mild colic, a stronger immune system, and an increase in body awareness and self-confidence. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>The Birth of Itsy Bitsy Yoga</b> <p> As a certified yoga teacher and infant developmental movement educator, I examine Hatha Yoga postures with the intention of adapting them for the nonverbal baby to do with or without a parent's help. The culmination of my professional background, twenty years of yoga and meditation practice, and a lifetime of study and experience in caring for babies and toddlers, is evident in Itsy Bitsy Yoga. Itsy Bitsy Yoga teaches parents how to support their baby's physical development and movement as nature intended. As much as possible I will tell you the role yoga plays in your child's development so that the experience and rewards are richer for you. </p><p> Not everything in this book is yoga in a traditional sense. I also translate the movements of an infant's natural developmental progression into playful practices. Many of my students are especially impressed that my poses and techniques are able to calm their babies so well. </p><p> I will show you how certain positions play a necessary role in your baby's physical development. I'll help you support your baby's physical development and the natural flow of unfolding gross motor skills. Lack of awareness in positioning, holding, or moving an infant can result in future lower back problems, reading difficulties, and challenges in focus. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>The History of Baby Yoga</b> <p> It is my belief that over thousands of years ago when yoga was first developing, yoga masters studied the movements of babies to create postures, or <i>asanas.</i> Through the practice of yoga, adults are returning to the unrestricted innocence and bliss of infancy. In a sense, yoga for babies has always existed. It is part of what babies do naturally. However, the natural movement babies need to experience is being reduced with the overuse of confining baby-holding devices such as infant car seats, walkers, seated activity centers, and strollers. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>Yoga Is Natural for Babies</b> <p> This photograph illustrates how an infant's development mirrors Classical Hatha Yoga postures developed more than five thousand years ago. For example, a baby coming up to a walking stance reflects the Downward Facing Dog Pose in Yoga. </p><p> Babies who are new to walking move into Downward Facing Dog repeatedly to transition from the floor into standing. Down Dog (as I like to call it in Itsy Bitsy Yoga) also occurs earlier in development when a baby is almost crawling. Throughout the book, I will explain what role Down Dog and other traditional Hatha Yoga postures play in your baby's development. </p><p> <i>Top Five Reasons Why Babies Are Natural Yogis (yoga students)</i> </p><p> </p><blockquote>1. Like yogis, babies prefer to breathe through the nose. <p> 2. Like yogis, babies are only concerned with the present moment. </p><p> 3. Like yogis, babies love unconditionally. </p><p> 4. Like yogis, babies practice nonviolence. </p><p> 5. Like yogis, babies practice yoga postures naturally as part of development.</p></blockquote> <p> <i>Is It Too Early or Too Late for My Baby or Toddler to Start Yoga?</i> </p><p> No. You're never too young or too old to start the practice of yoga. Parents and caregivers are invited to start practicing the postures in Itsy Bitsy Yoga with babies anytime between birth and twenty-four months. See Chapter 2 to get you started. </p><p> Yoga Takes as Little as Twenty Seconds and as Long as Twenty-five Minutes </p><p> The time you spend doing Itsy Bitsy Yoga is a vacation from the rest of your day. This developmentally nutritious activity also enhances your bond with your baby. A baby's or toddler's yoga practice can last twenty seconds to twenty-five minutes, depending on the baby's needs and your schedule. One of the book's nine Magic Poses (explained on page 10) can reduce fussiness almost instantaneously. In five to ten minutes you and your baby can engage in any one of the book's thirty-five Itsy Bitsy Yoga Series. Each series playfully combines three to seven postures to help you calm your baby, help your baby sleep longer, and grow stronger. Finally, you may choose to practice a number of the book's seventy yoga postures that are appropriate for your baby's current developmental stage. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>No Yoga Experience Needed</b> <p> No experience is necessary to share yoga and its benefits with a baby. Many people have always wanted to try yoga but thought they were too busy, until they became parents. In fact, more than half of the parents I teach had never done yoga before expecting a child. When a woman becomes pregnant she has more reason to pay attention to and care for her body in ways she might not have previously. Parents come to my classes to bond with and learn about their babies. After all, the word <i>yoga</i> means "to unite." When people learn how beneficial yoga is, they want to share it with their families. Also, my students have found yoga to be useful for enhancing the bond between a new baby and older siblings, grandparents, other family members, and nannies. </p><p> Molly and her fourteen-month-old son, Trevor, came to my class on a friend's referral. Molly had never tried yoga, but had known that someday she would like to. She thought it would be a good activity to share with her son, and it was! It turns out that Molly loved the time she spent practicing yoga with Trevor. Now, every time Trevor hears the words "Tree Pose," he assumes the Tree Pose in yoga! Molly has also begun practicing yoga for herself and finds that she has more energy to keep up with her growing toddler. </p><p> Copyright � 2004 by Helen Garabedian</p></p><h2>Bleach, Vol. 66 (66)</h2><p>Ichigo Kurosaki never asked for the ability to see ghosts--he was born with the gift.

Daniella has written over twelve books that have sold close to one million copies, including the bestseller, <i>Smoothies for Life!</i><p>Introduction</p> <p>If you or someone you love is at risk for or has been diagnosed with breast cancer, rest assured that you have powerful healing medicine in the food you eat every day. The reality is that certain foods are nature's cancer-fighters because they are rich in cancer-healing phytochemicals (natural plant chemicals). Not only are they helpful in preventing cancer, but certain fruits, vegetables, seeds, herbs, and spices are rich in nutrients that are proven to inhibit cancer by actually turning off cancer genes and reducing cancer cell growth. These compounds can change the course of cancer.</p> <p>In fact, many of the more progressive cancer clinics worldwide are starting to incorporate this research into their nutrition protocols to support and empower their patients throughout treatment. Targeting nutrition by prescribing nutrients based on an individual's needs not only supports healing but also enhances treatment efficacy.</p> <p>As a clinical nutritionist specializing in medical nutrition therapy, I have been developing protocols and dietary guidelines for more than twenty years. Early in my career, it became clear to me that my cancer patients needed answers to their dietary quandaries. Many of them were unable to eat heated foods because the smells triggered nausea, so they frequently preferred cold foods. Some of my patients reported that they couldn't eat much at one sitting so I made sure that the foods I recommended for them were nutrient dense, without extra carbohydrates and unnecessary bulk. Most of them were avoiding dairy products as they tend to increase mucus production and many of my new patients needed to gain muscle weight that had been lost due to treatment.</p> <p>I could see that I would need to find creative ways to help them get proper nutrition. Some of the nutrient deficiencies that my patients were experiencing were very serious, such as cachexia, which is a wasting syndrome characterized by weight loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite. Cachexia not only affects quality of life but is also estimated to be the cause of death in 15 to 20 percent of all cancer patients. The treatment for this type of muscle loss is protein powder (amino acids) and specifically creatine, so I began adding protein powders to the smoothie formulas I created for them. Once I saw how quickly a targeted approach to nutrition could reverse a condition, I became focused on personalized medical nutrition therapy.</p> <p>Most patients have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis. For example, large-scale studies have found that almost all women have vitamin D deficiency when they are first diagnosed with breast cancer. Vitamin D is needed for breast health as it plays key roles in immune function and breast tissue integrity. When our vitamin D levels drop below normal, we are in a carcinogenic state with a higher risk for developing breast cancer. By targeting and correcting deficiencies, we can dramatically change our health. This is true for specific nutrients and for broader nutrient categories, such as antioxidants and minerals.&nbsp;</p> <p>A poor diet not only increases the risk for cancer but also reduces the ability to heal from cancer. The average American diet contains processed foods, chemicals, agricultural pesticides, and lots of sugar and hydrogenated fats, all of which are associated with cancer risk. This type of diet leads to inflammation, which is a leading underlying cause of cancer development and the most common cause of fatigue in cancer patients. My smoothie recipes are chock-full of antioxidants and phytochemicals that reduce inflammation. Both patients and readers who drink these smoothies daily report greater energy and less fatigue.</p> <p>Creating functional smoothies containing active compounds has become a passion of mine, having seen the dramatic difference these drinks can make in an individual's health. Part of my process is to cull hundreds of studies on food nutrients found to affect recovery in various ways. First, I consider my patients' primary health concerns&#x2015;for example, the side effects of chemo, which may include nausea, inflammation, fatigue, and muscle loss&#x2015;and then I review the research to learn which food nutrients have been proven to support these conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>I pay attention to contraindicated foods that can wreak havoc for those with breast cancer. Some breast cancer subtypes require that the diet also be free of phytoestrogens, which are plant compounds that mimic hormones and stimulate the growth of cancer cells.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since dairy products increase the growth of some types of breast cancer cells, I recommend cultured coconut milk, almond milk, or hemp milk instead of dairy. My recipes are void of processed sugar and unhealthy fats and are free of common allergenic foods, such as gluten, corn, dairy, and soy.</p> <p>I also take into consideration the synergistic effects of nutrient compounds in the ingredients. Pairing food nutrients can actually amplify the healing power of your smoothies. For instance, black pepper increases the anti-inflammatory effects of turmeric by up to 2,000 percent and vitamin C enhances absorption of the mineral iron by sixfold. Therefore, combining iron-rich foods like Swiss chard, cashews, and bok choy with foods containing vitamin C, such as citrus and greens, will increase the health effects of iron. This is no small matter, as iron deficiency anemia is a common health problem in the United States and Canada.</p> <p>A more exotic anti-inflammatory combination that has been used for thousands of years is turmeric with black pepper. Turmeric, the yellow spice used in curries, is rich in the phytochemical curcumin, which becomes more bioavailable when ingested along with piperine in black pepper. In addition, carnosic acid in rosemary enhances the effects of curcumin. Recent studies have also proven that the phytochemicals limonene and cineole, which are found in cardamom, enhance the effects of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), present in kale and other brassica family vegetables.</p> <p>Prebiotics, which are the nondigestible fibers that feed probiotics, such as acidophilus and bifidophilus, support the growth of microbes in the gastro-intestinal tract. Most of the fruits and vegetables used in these recipes contain prebiotics, such as betaglucans from strawberries. This means that adding probiotics to plant-based smoothies will help activate those microbes in your body.</p> <p>Having a healthy amount of microbes in the gut is necessary for proper digestion. An efficient digestive tract contains a wide variety of microbial strains that assist in digestion. Probiotics also enhance the effects of certain nutrients, for example, they metabolize anthocyanins from berries and pomegranate.</p> <p>I find these nutrient and microbial interactions to be endlessly fascinating. A few decades ago, when I first started making smoothies, there was limited research available. Today there are studies being published daily from around the globe that direct our food nutrient choices for healing cancer. From these, I choose the studies that provide the most direct dietary guidance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some of these studies are done on animals, which is not only heartbreaking but also doesn't always provide information that is applicable to humans. Laboratory investigations with human cancer cells in petri dishes provide more direct proof of efficacy than many animal studies. Reports from human trials and correlational studies are the most revealing, as they involve direct testing of nutrients in humans, and they draw connections between nutrients and the health of populations.</p> <p>Researchers are getting so specific in their recommendations that they often provide dose details in the conclusion of the study. This is the gold that I am digging for when I am slogging through hundreds of studies. When I come across a report that provides the exact amount of a specific food used in the study that led to a positive health outcome (reduction in cancer, in this case), I can then replicate that dosage in a smoothie. For example, one recent study found that just two to three stone fruits per day (e.g., apricots, peaches, and plums) reduced the growth of breast cancer in the study's participants.</p> <p>I build my ingredients list from new research so that my recipes contain only effective cancer-supporting ingredients. I then use the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) database to find the foods that contain the highest concentration of these desired food nutrients. To ensure that the ingredients I use are not contaminated with agricultural chemicals or depleted of nutrients through processing, I choose whole, unprocessed, organic, and non-GMO foods.&nbsp;</p> <p>The final step to creating my 'functional' smoothies is to take my ingredients to the kitchen, where I spend hundreds of hours developing recipes. And, voil�: the finished product is a variety of powerful, healthy recipes that target breast cancer.</p> <p>Patients who drink my smoothies daily often report their mood and blood sugar levels are more stable and that they have more focus and motivation. They also report that their energy has increased enough that they are able to work and exercise throughout treatment.</p> <p>If you want to take a proactive approach to preventing or healing cancer, one of the most effective steps you can take is to drink a breast cancer smoothie each day. It is my hope that you not only enjoy these recipes but that they fortify you to enjoy vibrant health.</p> <p>�2016 Daniella Chace. All rights reserved.

With Nealy taking his time to explain the issues facing transgender youth, the book is truly accessible to any reader, no matter their level of interaction with, or understanding of transgender youth.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Metapsychology Online</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] comprehensive and compassionate narrative that will prove useful for anyone seeking to better understand and support transgender youth. . . . Nealy focuses not only on coming out as transgender but also on building and living a life as a happy transgender individual.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>BookPage</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Elijah Nealy has presented very complex issues in an incredibly clear and accessible manner. In order to really understand transgender adults coming into treatment it will help immensely if we understand the experiences of transgender youth. Many of the principles and guidelines presented are relevant to working with transgender-identified individuals of any age. . . . [I]ncredibly illuminating, even for the most experienced counselor.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>NALGAP Newsletter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In writing his book, Nealy has accomplished a huge and valuable feat that will serve to foster the healthy development of transgender and gender non-conforming youth, the acceptance and well-being of families, and the ability of therapists to improve their skills with youth and families.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>International Journal of Transgenderism</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A]n accessible, meticulously explained and supported introduction to the particular issues trans children and teenagers face, and how best to address them. . . . Nealy illustrates repeatedly through Transgender Children and Youth that acceptance can be fostered, schools held accountable and progress made.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Psych Central</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There is much to be gained from a work such as this. It fundamentally humanises a population that has been long been pathologised. It presents a stark image of the damage that can be done to young transgendered individuals. More importantly, it stands as a positive framework to nurture young people and celebrate diversity in all its forms.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></strong></p><h2>Snowfall on Cedar Trail: Two full books for the price of one</h2><p><b>From a <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author comes a heartwarming holiday romance between the a small-town florist and the handsome chief of police.</b> <b><br></b> Christmas is always bustling for Halona Locklear's flower shop, but this year, she's determined to take some time out to give her young son an extra special holiday.

This book was designed with a single idea in mind: what I wish I had known about gaming when I was starting to get serious about it. <br><br>This isn&#x2019;t really meant to be the kind of book you pick up and read starting on the first page and ending on the last, though you can do that if you want. It&#x2019;s more like a reference book&#x2014;an encyclopedia, by me, for gamers like us. It&#x2019;s a compendium of some of the tips and tricks I&#x2019;ve collected over the years, arranged in one place so that you can look to it when you need some guidance on the little things or the big ones. Whether you&#x2019;re brand-new to gaming, or you&#x2019;re a grizzled veteran, I think you&#x2019;ll learn something new. <br><br>The best place for a book like this is right by your computer or your console. It&#x2019;s meant to be used, not just read and then put on the shelf. You can look at it when you have questions or feel stuck. Revisit it occasionally to see if you learn something new. Write your own tips or discoveries in the margins, and dog-ear pages you find especially useful. If you ever ask me to sign your copy, I want to see that you&#x2019;ve really put it to use. <br><br>There are a couple content features in here you should know about before you start reading. &#x201c;Hot Fix!&#x201d; boxes explain quick ways to address common errors, while boxes marked &#x201c;Ninja&#x2019;s Way&#x201d; are specific illustrations of how I personally handle the challenges that I&#x2019;ll describe in more abstract terms in the main text. There are also exercises and even a little game. Finally, I&#x2019;ve added a list of resources at the back that you can check out once you think you&#x2019;ve exhausted what I&#x2019;ve written here. There&#x2019;s only so much you can say in a single book, so I want you to know where you can go when you&#x2019;re ready to take your game to the next level. <br><br>Unlike games, you only get one chance when it comes to books, so I&#x2019;ve tried to make the wisdom in here as timeless as possible. That means I don&#x2019;t talk much about how to play specific games. Instead, I talk about gaming. I&#x2019;ll use Fortnite, Apex Legends, and plenty of other games as examples throughout the book, but most of the content in here is meant to be bigger than any one game. Games come and go, and you&#x2019;ll have to go with them. But if you pay attention to the lessons in this book, you&#x2019;ll find that you&#x2019;re never really starting over. Who knows&#x2014;maybe you&#x2019;ll even beat me someday. Or not. That&#x2019;s up to you. <br><br>See You In-Game, <br>Tyler</p><h2>Emboldened: A Vision for Empowering Women in Ministry</h2><p>Throughout Scripture and church history, women have been central to the mission of God. But all too often women have lacked opportunities to minister fully. Many churches lack visible examples of women in ministry and leadership. Pastor Tara Beth Leach issues a stirring call for a new generation of women in ministry: to teach, to preach, to shepherd, and to lead. God not only permits women to minister&#x2015;he emboldens, empowers, and unleashes women to lead out of the fullness of who they are. The church cannot reach its full potential without women using their God-given gifts. Leach provides practical expertise for how women can find their place at the table, escape impostor syndrome, face opposition, mentor others, and much more. When women teach, preach, lead, evangelize, pastor, and disciple, and when men partner to embolden the women in their lives, the church's imagination expands to better reflect God's story and hope for the world.</p><p>"With grace and honesty, Tara Beth Leach unpacks her journey of becoming a woman senior pastor in a prominent evangelical church. In doing so, she blazes a trail for us all, both men and women, in empowering women for ministry. Robust in its theology, practical in its wisdom, <em>Emboldened</em> tells us why God's mission demands nothing less of us in these times: women <em>and</em> men together leading God's church." (David Fitch, Northern Seminary, author of Faithful Presence)<br><br>"A double shot of spiritual espresso to awaken, encourage, and embolden every woman in the kingdom of God." (Frank Viola, author of From Eternity to Here and God's Favorite Place on Earth)<br><br>"It's time for the church to expand its imagination to include the strengths that women bring to the table as senior leaders, and Tara Beth Leach helps us do just that in this engaging book. Finally we have a primer for women in pastoral ministry that is both practical and theological. <em>Emboldened</em> is unflinching in naming the challenges that keep women sidelined in the church while at the same time inspiring those willing to brave those challenges. This will be the first book I recommend to women considering vocational ministry." (Gail Wallace, cofounder, The Junia Project)<br><br>"One day, Lord willing, the American church will look back in disbelief at our failure to see the emboldening of women as essential to living faithfully under the rule and reign of God. This book, however, presents the opportunity to bring us much nearer to that day. I commend it strongly to all, but especially to my fellow brothers in Christ; may we heed this vision as a fresh, kingdom-oriented call to 'biblical manhood.'" (JR Rozko, codirector, Missio Alliance)<br><br>"Pastor Tara Beth Leach has produced an inspiring writing to embolden those who are called for ministry. For women called to vocational ministry the pathway is not easy, but Leach reminds us that the call cannot be ignored. This is the mission of God, and in the words of Pastor Tara Beth, 'I get to do this.' This book is a vital new resource for the church. It's for all women who are called to ministry and for those who will embolden others who have been called." (Carla Sunberg, general superintendent, Church of the Nazarene)<br><br>"<em>Emboldened</em> is a clarion call of instruction and inspiration to not settle for fifty percent participation, but for the church to engage one hundred percent of its people in the mission. My friend Tara Beth Leach is an important young voice that offers the church of Jesus a much better vision of the future. If you want to be challenged, inspired, or catch a glimpse of the church's tomorrow, read <em>Emboldened</em>." (Dave Ferguson, visionary leader of NewThing, author of Finding Your Way Back to God and Starting Over)<br><br>"Tara Beth has chosen the right word to describe not only women who have gone before us, what God is doing among women today, but also what especially church leaders need to be doing today: embolden the woman as a way of letting the gifts of God be given to the people of God." (from the foreword by Scot McKnight, Northern Seminary)<br><br>"We both believe that if we are to be the transformational movement that Jesus intended us to be, we are going to have to activate the God-given agency of women in the organized church and beyond. Until that happens, the body of Christ will continue to limp along. Tara Beth's new book is a loving invitation for the church to take women seriously enough to empower them for the frontline of leadership and mission. Viva!" (Deb Hirsch and Alan Hirsch, authors and leaders in the missional church movement)<br><br>"Tara Beth Leach perfectly articulates the ache I feel for the day when the church will embolden men and women to serve God in all spheres of ministry without gender qualifiers. It's a passionate call for revolutionary change in our churches, but it's also a warmly written guide, full of very practical advice, useful steps, and stories to sustain you in that journey. Please read this book. Please." (Michael Frost, Morling College, Sydney)<br><br>"Over the years, I've heard the keepers of patriarchy shriek and howl over the imagined ills of what they deem the 'feminization of the church.' But if the 'feminization of the church' means more pastors like Tara Beth Leach, I'm all for it! I fervently hope that <em>Emboldened</em> will help pave the way for many more women in pastoral ministry." (Brian Zahnd, lead pastor, Word of Life Church, St. Joseph, Missouri, author of Sinners in the Hands of a Loving God)<br><br>"Women who are called to ministry need a pastor to tell them they're not alone, that they can do this. They need a voice to speak truth over their calling and identity. In Tara Beth Leach they find such a voice. Her warm, pastoral authority twice blesses her readers, both as recipients of her care and as they watch her model what ministry can be."

Whether it is used by the NSA to fight terrorism or by online retailers to predict customers&#x2019; buying patterns, big data is a revolution occurring around us, in the process of forever changing economics, science, culture, and the very way we think. But it also poses new threats, from the end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven&#x2019;t even done yet, based on big data&#x2019;s ability to predict our future behavior. What we have already seen is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br><i>Big Data</i> is the first major book about this earthshaking subject, with two leading experts explaining what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. <br><br>&#x201c;An optimistic and practical look at the Big Data revolution &#x2014; just the thing to get your head around the big changes already underway and the bigger changes to come.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Cory Doctorow, boingboing.com</p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What did it take to write <em>Big Data</em>?</strong></p> <p>A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for <em>The Economist</em>, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book <em>Delete</em> had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted <em>Big Data</em> to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are you big data&#x2019;s cheerleaders?</strong></p> <p>A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big data&#x2019;s likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it.</p> <p><strong>Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise?</strong></p> <p>A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing people&#x2019;s everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Q. Is <em>Big Data</em> then primarily a story about economic efficiency?</strong></p> <p>A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but that&#x2019;s only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal change&#x2014;from urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life.</p> <p><strong>Q. So big data offers only &#x201c;upside&#x201d;? </strong></p> <p>A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book &#x201c;the dark side of big data.&#x201d; However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by &#x201c;propensity&#x201d; -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the &#x201c;fetishization&#x201d; of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations.</p> <p><strong>Q. What can we do about this &#x201c;dark side&#x201d;?</strong></p> <p>A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big data&#x2019;s risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues. If we do not take action soon, it might be too late.</p>VIKTOR MAYER-SCH�NBERGER is a professor of Internet governance and regulation at Oxford University.&nbsp;He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age</i>. <p>KENNETH CUKIER is the data editor of the <i>Economist</i> and a prominent commentator on developments in big data. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>READING-LITERATURE Second Reader (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Third volume in the series of Reading-Literature readers, whose purpose is to train children in reading and appreciating literature through the reading of literature.

Research shows men are often more violent and less willing to confront and deal with their emotions than women. Written by a psychologist who specializes in the treatment of male rage, <i>Beyond Anger</i> shows the angry--and miserable--man how to change his life and relationships for the better. <br><br>This book helps men understand their anger by explaining what the specific symptoms of chronic anger are and by showing angry men how their actions negatively affect family, friends, and coworkers. It helps men control violent feelings by using simple exercises--developed especially for men--to identify when and why anger occurs and by helping them form new habits to prevent anger before it starts. Women, too, will learn essential strategies for understanding and helping the angry men in their lives. <i><br><br>Beyond Anger</i> is honest, tough, and real. In this revised edition, Harbin will update references throughout and discuss new topics such as the role of the internet and social media in fueling anger and how to protect yourself against these pitfalls, as well as a discussion on anger and aging, the political landscape and anger, PTSD, a brand-new section on preventing relapse into anger, and many other relevant, timely topics. <br></p><p><b>Thomas J.

An Associate Professor in the MFA program at Rutgers-Newark University, she is spending the 2017-18 academic year as the Shearing Fellow for Distinguished Writers at the Beverly Rogers, Carol C. Harter Black Mountain Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She blogs on writing at TayariJones.com/blog, and she lives in Brooklyn.Based on the Atlanta child murders of 1979-1980, this wrenching debut novel is told from the perspective of three Atlanta fifth-graders living in the midst of the crisis. Tasha is a sweet, conflicted middle-class girl navigating the harsh social waters of her school. Rodney, "the weirdest boy in class," is an unpopular kid who feels both pushed and ignored by his perfectionist parents. Octavia is a whip-smart, confident social outcast who carefully notes that she lives "across the street" from the projects. Jones, who was a child herself in Atlanta in the late '70s and early '80s, weaves her tale with consummate ease, shifting from third to second to first person as she switches narrators. The details of the children's everyday life playground fights, school cafeteria breakfasts, candy store visits are convincingly presented and provide an emotional context for the murders. When classmates begin disappearing, we know that they, along with their peers, are not one-dimensional innocents. One night when Octavia sneaks a late-night look at the local news, she sees a now-missing classmate flash on the screen. "In the picture he looked like a regular boy from our class. He was by himself so you couldn't tell that he was shorter than most of them and just nicer and smarter than all of them put together. Kodak commercials say that a picture is worth a thousand words, but the one they showed of Rodney ain't worth more than three or four. Boy. Black. Dead." This strongly grounded tale hums with the rhythms of schoolyard life and proves Jones to be a powerful storyteller.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Caps For Sale / Se Venden Gorras (Reading Rainbow Book) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p><em>This high-quality Spanish-language book can be enjoyed by fluent Spanish speakers as well as those learning the language, whether at home or in a classroom.</em></p><p><strong>Esta edici�n en espa�ol acerca de un vendedor ambulante y una banda de monos traviesos se llena de calidez, el humor y la sencillez.

But when the Nazis start closing in on the city, life changes irreversibly. Although he has three daughters, Lisa's father is able to secure only one berth on the Kindertransport. The family decides to send Lisa to London so that she may pursue her dreams of a career as a concert pianist. Separated from her beloved family, Lisa bravely endures the trip and a disastrous posting outside London before finding her way to the Willesden Lane Orphanage.<br><br>Her music inspires the other orphanage children, and they, in turn, cheer her on in her efforts to make good on her promise to her family to realize her musical potential. Through hard work and sheer pluck, Lisa wins a scholarship to study piano at the Royal Academy. As she supports herself and studies, she makes a new life for herself and dreams of reconnecting with the family she was forced to leave behind. The resulting tale delivers a message of the power of music to uplift the human spirit and to grant the individual soul endurance, patience, and peace.<br><br><i>*Includes a reading group guide*</i><br></p><p>Mona Golabek is a Grammy-nominated recording artist, internationally celebrated concert pianist, and star of the one-woman show<i> The Pianist of Willesden Lane.<br></i><br>Lee Cohen is a journalist, screenwriter, and poet.<br>One of 10,000 Jewish children sent to England by fearful parents at the dawn of WWII, aspiring pianist Lisa Jura was 14 when her family put her on a Kindertransport train in Vienna. In this alternately heart-wrenching and uplifting story, Jura's daughter, Golabek, a pianist, and writer Cohen trace the six years Jura spent in London, where she found surrogate families in the 31 other young refugees at the Willesden Lane hostel, and in the working-class British women at the East End garment factory that employed her. The authors beautifully capture Jura's passion for music and her determination to realize her dream of becoming a concert pianist. Her quest to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music seems to inject hope into everyone with whom she comes into contact: the hostel owner provides her with a piano and practice time, her housemates band together to drill her on technique and theory, and a co-worker makes her an audition outfit. Yet this is no Babes in Arms. Jura's struggle to hold herself together on the trip to England and as she makes a life for herself without the guidance of her beloved mother is as bleak as her musical successes are joyful. And the depictions of V-Day are especially vivid: rather than celebrate with the masses, Jura retreats to the hostel. The war may be over, but for her and her fellow young refugees waiting to learn the fate of their families, the tragedy will continue. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Long Fatal Love Chase</h2><p>"I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom," cries impetuous Rosamond Vivian to her callous grandfather.

This potato diet simply called for one to eat nothing but potatoes for a few days at a time, promising that fat men become as &#x201c;lean as they ought to be.&#x201d; One hundred and sixty-seven years later, we are fatter and sicker than ever, but the potato diet still works. Potatoes contains natural drug-like agents that affect inflammation, hunger, insulin, sleep, dreams, mood, and body weight. The potato is the best diet pill ever invented.The potato hack is a short-term intervention (3-5 days) where one eats nothing but potatoes. This short mono-food experiment will strengthen your immune system and provide you with all of the nutrition you need to remain energetic, sleep great, and, as a side-effect, lose weight. The potato hack will help you develop a new relationship with food, hunger, taste, and yourself. The potato hack is not just for the overweight. As noted in 1849, anyone with digestive complaints who follows an all-potato diet for a few days at a time will find their digestion improves greatly. Modern science shows that simple diets high in fiber create an intestinal microbiome that is highly diverse and stable. This diversity and stability is lacking in most people and leads to digestive complaints like Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Small intestinal bacterial overgrowths (SIBO). The "modern dyspeptic gut" affects millions of people and costs billions of dollars annually. The answer might be as simple as 3-5 days of potatoes. You don't need this book to do the potato hack. Just eat potatoes until full every day for 3-5 days. It really is that simple! This book explains the science behind the potato hack, some variations on the basic hack, recipes, and what to do if it does not work as advertised. Also found in The Potato Hack is a comprehensive review of resistant starch, gut health, potato history, and a growing guide for those that want to grow their own. Most of the photography throughout the book was done by award-winning photographer, Ann Overhulse. The artfully photographed potatoes found on the cover and on 30 pages within are well worth the full price of the book. Guaranteed that after reading The Potato Hack, you will never look at potatoes the same.</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <i>"Dieters know that it's tough to lose more than a pound or two in a week.

I've always considered <i>The Stand</i>--a long-time favorite--a towering tour de force, and have owed its author a debt as this was the first novel I could convince my older son to read from cover to cover.<p> But with <i>Lisey's Story</i>, King has accomplished one more feat. He broke my heart.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is, at its core, a love story--heart-wrenching, passionate, terrifying and tender. It is the multi-layered and expertly crafted tale of a twenty-five year marriage, and a widow's journey through grief, through discovery and--this is King, after all--through a nightmare scape of the ordinary and extraordinary. Through Lisey's mind and heart, the reader is pulled into the intimacies of her marriage to bestselling novelist Scott Landon, and through her we come to know this complicated, troubled and heroic man.</p><p> Two years after his death, Lisey sorts through her husband's papers and her own shrouded memories. Following the clues Scott left her and her own instincts, she embarks on a journey that risks both her life and her sanity. She will face Scott's demons as well as her own, traveling into the past and into Boo'ya Moon, the seductive and terrifying world he'd shown her. There lives the power to heal, and the power to destroy.</p><p> Lisey Landon is a richly wrought character of charm and complexity, of realized inner strength and redoubtable humor. As the central figure she drives the story, and the story is so vividly textured, the reader will draw in the perfumed air of Boo'ya Moon, will see the sunlight flood through the windows of the Scott's studio--or the night press against them. Her voice will be clear in your ear as you experience the fear and the wonder. If your heart doesn't hitch at the demons she faces in this world and the other, if it doesn't thrill at her courage and endurance, you're going to need to check with a cardiologist, first chance.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is bright and brilliant. It's dark and desperate. While I'll always consider <i>The Shining</i>, my first ride on King's wild Tilt-A-Whirl, a gorgeous, bloody jewel, I found, on this latest ride, a treasure box heaped with dazzling gems.</p><p> A few of them have sharp, hungry teeth. <i>--Nora Roberts</i> </p><br>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

In this rollicking memoir, <i>So, Anyway...</i>, Cleese takes readers on a Grand Tour of his ascent in the entertainment world, from his humble beginnings in a sleepy English town and his early comedic days at Cambridge University (with future Python partner Graham Chapman), to the founding of the landmark comedy troupe that would propel him to worldwide renown.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cleese was just days away from graduating Cambridge and setting off on a law career when he was visited by two BBC executives, who offered him a job writing comedy for radio. That fateful moment&#x2014;and a near-simultaneous offer to take his university humor revue to London&#x2019;s famed West End&#x2014;propelled him down a different path, cutting his teeth writing for stars like David Frost and Peter Sellers, and eventually joining the five other Pythons to pioneer a new kind of comedy that prized invention, silliness, and absurdity.

I was eight and five-sixths. My audience was a pack of nine-year-olds, who were jeering at me and baying, &#x201c;Chee-eese! Chee-eese!&#x201d; I kept climbing the steps, despite the feelings of humiliation and fear. But above all, I was bewildered. How had I managed to attract so much attention? What had I done to provoke this aggression? And . . . how on earth did they know that my family surname had once been Cheese?<br><br>As Matron &#x201c;Fishy&#x201d; Findlater gave me the customary new-boy physical examination, I tried to gather my thoughts. My parents had always warned me to keep away from &#x201c;nasty rough boys.&#x201d; What, then, were they doing at a nice school like St. Peter&#x2019;s? And how was I supposed to avoid them?<br><br>Much of my predicament was that I was not just a little boy, but a very tall little boy. I was five foot three, and would pass the six-foot mark before I was twelve. So it was hard to fade away into the background, as I often wished to&#x2014;particularly later when I&#x2019;d become taller than any of the masters. It didn&#x2019;t help that one of them, Mr. Bartlett, always referred to me as &#x201c;a prominent citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>In addition, as a result of my excessive height, I had &#x201c;outgrown my strength,&#x201d; and my physical weakness meant that I was uncoordinated and awkward; so much so that a few years later my PE teacher, Captain Lancaster, was to describe me as &#x201c;six foot of chewed string.&#x201d; Add to that the fact that I had had no previous experience of the feral nature of gangs of young boys, and you will understand why my face bore the expression of an authentic coward as &#x201c;Fishy&#x201d; opened the door and coaxed me out towards my second public appearance. <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, it&#x2019;s only teasing,&#x201d; she said. What consolation was that? You could have said the same at Nuremberg. But at least the chanting had stopped, and now there was an expectant silence as I forced myself down the stairs.&nbsp; Then... <br><br>&#x201c;Are you a Roundhead or a Cavalier?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br><br>Faces were thrust at me, each one of them demanding, &#x201c;Round�head or Cavalier?&#x201d; What were they talking about? <br><br>Had I understood the question, I would almost certainly have fainted, such a delicate little flower was I. (And perhaps I should explain to the more delicately nurtured that I was not being asked to offer my considered views on the relative merits of the opposing forces in the English Civil War, but to reveal whether or not I had been circumcised.) However, my first day at prep school was not a total failure. By the time I got home I had learned the meaning of two new words&#x2014;&#x201c;pathetic&#x201d; and &#x201c;wet&#x201d;&#x2014;though I had to find Dad&#x2019;s dictionary to look up &#x201c;sissy.&#x201d; <br><br>Why was I so . . . ineffectual? Well, let&#x2019;s begin at my beginning. I was born on October 27, 1939, in Uphill, a little village south of Weston-super-Mare, and separated from it by the mere width of a road which led inland from the Weston seafront. My first memory, though, is not of Uphill but of a tree in the village of Brent Knoll, a few miles away, under whose shade I recall lying, while I looked through its branches to the bright blue sky above. The sunlight is catching the leaves at different angles, so that my eye flickers from one patch of colour to the next, the verdant foliage displaying a host of verdant hues. (I thought I would try to get &#x201c;verdant,&#x201d; &#x201c;hues&#x201d; and &#x201c;foliage&#x201d; into this paragraph, as my English teachers always believed that they were signs of creative talent. Though I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have used &#x201c;verdant&#x201d; twice.) <br><br>Of course, I&#x2019;m not <i>sure </i>it is my first memory; I&#x2019;m sure I used to <i>think </i>it was; and I <i>like </i>to think it was, too, because it would make sense, baby me lying in a pram, contentedly watching the interplay of the glinting verdant foliage and its beautiful hues. <br>One thing I do know for certain, though, is that shortly before this incident with the tree, the Germans bombed Weston-super-Mare. I&#x2019;ll just repeat that... <br>On August 14, 1940, German planes bombed Weston-super-Mare. This is verifiable: it was in all the papers. Especially the <i>Weston Mer�cury</i>. Most Westonians were confident the raid had been a mistake. The Germans were a people famous for their efficiency, so why would they drop perfectly good bombs on Weston-super-Mare, when there was nothing in Weston that a bomb could destroy that could possibly be as valuable as the bomb that destroyed it? That would mean that every explosion would make a tiny dent in the German economy. <br><br>The Germans did return, however, and several times, which mys�tified everyone. Nevertheless I can&#x2019;t help thinking that Westonians actually quite liked being bombed: it gave them a sense of signifi�cance that was otherwise lacking from their lives. But that still leaves the question <i>why </i>would the Hun have bothered? Was it just Teutonic <i>joie de vivre</i>? Did the Luftwaffe pilots mistake the Weston seafront for the Western Front? I have heard it quite seriously put forward by older Westonians that it was done at the behest of William Joyce, the infamous &#x201c;Lord Haw-Haw,&#x201d; who was hanged as a traitor in 1944 by the British for making Nazi propaganda radio broadcasts to Britain during the war. When I asked these amateur historians why a man of Irish descent who was born in Brooklyn would have such an animus against Weston that he would buttonhole Hitler on the matter, they fell silent. I prefer to believe that it was because of a grudge held by Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering on account of an unsavoury in�cident on Weston pier in the 1920s, probably involving No�l Coward and Terence Rattigan. <br><br>My father&#x2019;s explanation, however, makes the most sense: he said the Germans bombed Weston to show that they really do have a sense of humour. <br><br>Whatever the truth of the matter, two days after that first raid we had moved to a quaint little Somerset village called Brent Knoll. Dad had had quite enough of big bangs during his four years in the trenches in France, and since he was up to nothing in Weston that was vital to the war effort, he spent the day after the bombing driv�ing around the countryside near Weston until he found a small farm�house, owned by a Mr. and Mrs. Raffle, who agreed to take the Cleese family on as paying guests. I love the fact that he didn&#x2019;t <i>mess around</i>. We were out of there! And it was typically smart of him to find a farm, where, at a time of strict rationing, an egg or a chicken or even a small pig could go missing without attracting too much attention. <br><br>Mother told me once that some Westonians privately criticised Dad for retreating so soon. They apparently felt it would have been more dignified to have waited a week or so before running away. I think this view misses the essential point of running away, which is to do it the moment the idea has occurred to you. Only an obses�sional procrastinator would cry, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s run for our lives, but not till Wednesday afternoon.&#x201d; <br><br>Back to the tree. I revisited the farm many years later, and, just as I thought I remembered, there was a huge chestnut tree in the middle of the front lawn, under which I might easily have lain in a pram. In 1940 the farmhouse had been one of a row of houses of me�dium size strung along a road, with fields opposite; it didn&#x2019;t look very farm-like from the front, but when you walked up the drive and got to the back of the house you saw there was a proper farmyard, with mud and chickens and rusty farm equipment and ferrets in cages and rabbits in wooden hutches.<br><br>And it was this location that provides my second memory. (It must come after the first because in it I am now standing up.) I was bitten by a rabbit. <br><br>Or rather, I was nibbled by a rabbit, but, because I was such a weedy, namby-pamby little pansy, I reacted as though I&#x2019;d lost a limb. It was the sheer unfairness of it all that so upset me. One minute, I was saying, &#x201c;Hello, Mr. Bunny!&#x201d; and smiling at its sweet little face and funny floppy ears. The next, the fucker savaged me. It seemed so gratuitous. What, I asked myself, had I done to the rabbit to deserve this psychotic response? <br><br>The more pertinent question, though, is: why was I such a <i>wuss</i>? And the obvious answer is that it&#x2019;s because I was the only child of older, over-protective parents. I have a memory (No. 3) to support this. I&#x2019;m now about three and am in the Red Cow Inn, the hub and beating heart of Brent Knoll. Somehow I bang my hand, and just before I burst into tears, I hold it up to my father and howl, &#x201c;Daddy, look! I&#x2019;ve hurt my precious thumb!&#x201d; This, to my astonishment, gets a big laugh. Is my thumb <i>not </i>precious, I wonder? Dad certainly thinks it is. When the occasion demands, he always says, &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ve hurt your precious &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; [fill in applicable body part].&#x201d; <br><br>I hesitate to criticise Dad, because what sanity I have I owe to his loving kindness. But there&#x2019;s no doubt that he did pamper me, and such early coddling was one of the reasons I embarked on a wussy lifestyle. Throughout my schoolboy days I never felt very manly, or strong, or virile, or vigorous, or healthily aggressive. At school I avoided playground &#x201c;gangs,&#x201d; because I didn&#x2019;t understand why anyone would want to behave like that. I loved ball games, but was always appalled at how rough, for example, rugby looked, even at the safe distance I kept while pretending to play it. When I was seventeen, my assistant Clifton College housemaster, Alec MacDonald, finally took me to task for funking tackles. Describing my efforts as &#x201c;danc�ing around like a disabled fairy,&#x201d; he ordered me to watch while he gave a demonstration of how to tackle properly. He asked a member of the first XV, Tony Rogers, to run at him. He closed in on Rogers, and then went in hard, just as Rogers tried to sidestep him. The result was that the top of Mr. MacDonald&#x2019;s head came into sharp contact with Rogers&#x2019; right hip. Mr. MacDonald was unavailable for teaching later that afternoon; indeed he did not reappear for forty-eight hours. When he did, I was too cowardly to remind him that he had specifi�cally told me that &#x201c;if you go in hard, you never get hurt.&#x201d; So when I see international rugby teams lumbering out at Twickenham, I look at them with awe, but also with a sense of being genetically discon�nected from them. I was not born to be butch, and I have accepted my innate unmanliness without complaint. Besides, it seems to me that cowards very seldom cause trouble, which is probably why there is a history of them being shot by people who do.[1] <br><br>None of this, incidentally, is to say that my infant wussiness was in any way admirable. But while I was undeniably a gutless little weed there was an upside: at least I didn&#x2019;t display the habitual mind�less aggression of some young males. Better a wuss than a psycho, I say, and I am proud that I have never been able to force myself to watch cage fighting. <br>If part of my weedy outlook on life came from my father&#x2019;s pam�pering, a fair proportion was down to my complicated relationship with my mother. And in this context another early memory comes to mind. I am lying in bed, falling asleep, when a noise causes me to turn and see shadows moving on the half-open door of my bedroom. They are shadows of my parents fighting. Dad has been coming into my room and Mum has started attacking him, pummelling him with a flurry of blows which he is trying to fend off. There is no sound&#x2014;I sense they are both trying not to wake me&#x2014;and the memory has no emotion attached, although it is very clear. Just the shadows which last a few seconds and then . . . silence. As I write this, my throat tightens a little. The level of violence I&#x2019;m describing is low: there are no shillelaghs or chainsaws here, just lower-middle-class fisticuffs, with no prospect of Grievous Bodily Harm, as English law calls it. Nevertheless, my beloved dad, a kind and decent person, is being at�tacked by this unknowable creature who is widely rumoured to be my mother. <br><br>Young children have so little life experience that they inevitably assume that what happens around and to them is the norm. I re�member that when my daughter Cynthia was very young she was surprised to discover that some of her friends&#x2019; fathers did not work in television. So it would have been hard for me to describe my rela�tionship with my mother as problematic because I had no idea what the word &#x201c;motherly&#x201d; conveyed to most people. Dad once described to me how, during the First World War, he had witnessed a wounded soldier lying in a trench and crying out for his mother. &#x201c;Why on earth would he cry for her?&#x201d; I wondered. When, over the years, I began to hear friends tell me that their mother was their best friend, someone with whom they routinely discussed their daily life, and to whom they looked for emotional support, I simply thought, &#x201c;How wonderful that must be...&#x201d; <br>Please do not think that I am loftily labeling her a &#x201c;bad mother.&#x201d; In many ways she was a good mother; sometimes a very good mother. In all day-to-day matters she was extremely diligent: preparing good meals, making sure I was properly clothed and shod and warm and dry, keeping the house neat and clean, and fiercely protective of me. Under light hypnosis, I once recalled a German air raid, with the sound of the bombers not far away, and Mother throwing herself on top of me, under a big kitchen table. If it was a false memory, it&#x2019;s still what she would have done.<br><br>From a practical point of view, then, she was impeccable. But she was also self-obsessed and anxious, and that could make life with her very uncomfortable indeed.<br>A clue to her self-obsession, I always felt, was her extraordinary lack of general knowledge. On one of her visits to London in the late &#x2019;80s, a salad was prepared for lunch which contained quails&#x2019; eggs. She asked what kind of eggs they were and I explained that they were moles&#x2019; eggs, and that when we wanted them, we would go up to Hampstead Heath very early in the morning, as moles laid them at the entrance to their burrows during the night, collect the eggs and make sure we ate them the same day before they had time to hatch. She listened with great attention, as my family&#x2019;s jaws sagged, and said she thought them &#x201c;delicious.&#x201d; Later that day she caught a men�tion of Mary, Queen of Scots. She recognised the name and asked me who this was. With my family listening, I pushed the envelope a little, telling her that Mary was a champion Glaswegian darts player who had been killed in the Blitz. &#x201c;What a shame,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>I was being a bit naughty, of course, but I also wanted to prove to my family the truth of a comment I had made earlier about Mother, which they had not accepted on first hearing. I had told them that <i>she had no information about anything that was not going to affect her life directly in the immediate future; </i>and that consequently she possessed no general knowledge&#x2014;and when I said no general knowledge, I didn&#x2019;t mean very, very little. Naturally they had thought I was exaggerating. <br><br>And the reason for this was not that she was unintelligent, but that she lived her life in such a constant state of high anxiety, border�ing on incipient panic, that she could focus only on the t...</p><h2>The Strangest Secret</h2><p>An unabridged edition to include the text from both the 1956 audio and subsequent video version of Earl Nightingale&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Strangest Secret,&#x2019; considered one of the greatest motivational books ever compiled -</p><p><b>Earl Nightingale</b> was the host of his own daily commentary radio program on WGN in Chicago.

According to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the ability to find true fulfillment lies within each of us. In this very special book, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, Nobel Prize winner, and bestselling author helps readers embark upon the path to enlightenment with a stunning illumination of the timeless wisdom and an easy-access reference for daily practice. <br> Divided into a series of distinct steps that will lead spiritual seekers toward enlightenment, <i>How to Practice</i> is a constant companion in the quest to practice morality, meditation, and wisdom. This accessible book will guide you toward opening your heart, refraining from doing harm, and maintiaining mentaltranquility as the Dalai Lama shows you how to overcome everyday obstacles, from feelings of anger and mistrust to jealousy, insecurity, and counterproductive thinking. Imbued with His Holiness' vivacious spirit and sense of playfulness, <i>How to Practice</i> offers sage and practical insight into the human psyche and into the deepest aspirations that bind us all together.</p><p>As a primer on living the good life, few books compete with <i>How to Practice</i>, another profound offering from the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Westerners may be confused by the book's title, assuming that it focuses solely on Buddhist meditation and prayer techniques. Though it does address meditation and prayer, at its core this is a book that demonstrates how day-to-day living can be a spiritual practice. There are two ways to create happiness:<blockquote>The first is external. By obtaining better clothes, better shelter, and better friends we can find a certain measure of happiness and satisfaction. The second is through mental development, which yields inner happiness. However, these two approaches are not equally viable. External happiness cannot last long without its counterpart.... However, if you have peace of mind you can find happiness even under the most difficult circumstances.</blockquote> As he has in previous books (<i>An Open Heart</i>, <i>The Art of Happiness</i>), the Dalai Lama reminds us that developing peace of mind means paying attention to our daily attitudes and choices as well as taking the time to meditate and be prayerful. The six-part book covers Buddhist meditation techniques and visualization exercises as well as daily thoughts and actions that foster morality and wisdom. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He frequently describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. He passed his scholastic examinations with honors at the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1959, the same year Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives.<br> <br>His Holiness frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of interreligious harmony, and securing the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture, and religion. As a superior scholar trained in the classical texts of the Nalanda tradition of Indian Buddhism, he is able to distill the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy in clear and inspiring language, his gift for pedagogy imbued with his infectious joy. Connecting scientists with Buddhist scholars, he helps unite contemplative and modern modes of investigation, bringing ancient tools and insights to bear on the acute problems facing the contemporary world.

Certainly, they are more complicated, more wicked, and more passionate--takers of great risk. I think people have been put off this period because it has been so well studied by military historians that it has been regarded as being just about battles. But there is so much more to it than this! The history of the women of the period has been very neglected because of this emphasis on battles and thus the male leaders. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> What appealed to you about using Elizabeth Woodville as the main character in a novel? In what ways do you think modern women can identify with Elizabeth?<br><br> <b>A:</b> The things I discovered about Elizabeth in the first days of my reading about this period told me at once that she would fascinate me, and she has done so. Her background as a descendant of a family who claim to be related to a goddess was enough to have me absolutely enchanted straightaway. It is in the historical record that her mother was widely believed to be a witch, and that charge was leveled at Elizabeth also. This is exciting enough, but it also indicates that people were afraid of Elizabeth's power, and I am interested in powerful women. I think she will fascinate modern women in the same way that many historical women strike a chord: despite so many changes in the world, women are still trying to find happiness, manage their children, seek advantage, and avoid the persecution of misogynists. As women of any time, we have a lot in common. Despite the amazing advances in the rights of women (and I am so grateful for these myself), the struggle for women's freedom, independence, and the right to exercise power goes on. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> Throughout the novel there are scenes relating the story of the goddess Melusina. Is this based on an actual historical fable, or is it something you created for the novel?<br><br> <b>A:</b> The fable of Melusina is well known, perhaps to everyone, in its retelling as the story of the Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen and then in the Disney movie. As I say at the beginning of the novel, the legend of Melusina goes far back in time, perhaps to the classical legends, perhaps even earlier. The fable was studied by Carl Jung; Melusina has been identified as a form of the material of the world--the dark, watery element that combines with the sun in the alchemist's &#x201c;chemical wedding.&#x201d; This is a potent myth, indeed, and I retell the story here in a way that speaks to my characters and to me. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> &#x201c;These are not chivalrous times; these are not the times of knights in the dark forest and beautiful ladies in moonlit fountains and promises of love that will be ballads, sung forever&#x201d; (page 22), you write in <em>The White Queen</em>. Is there a tendency to romanticize history, both for writers and readers? How do you make sure to realistically portray all aspects of the time period you're depicting, even the more difficult ones?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Yes, indeed. These are not chivalrous times. I suspect that no times have ever been chivalrous times. We glamorize the past, and we romanticize it; we even look back at our own personal histories and cast a rosy glow or an enhanced dark shadow over our own childhoods. I keep my writing grounded in realism by reading a great deal before I start writing, by looking at the record with a critical eye, and by being skeptical of grandiose claims. Having said that, I too find it hard to resist the charm of Edward or Elizabeth or the marvelous character Jacquetta or any of the other powerful and interesting people who strove for themselves and for their families in these dangerous times. These are not chivalrous or romantic times, but they are times of danger--and in such circumstances one sees both the worst and best in people.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What challenges, if any, did you face when writing about the battle scenes and the military strategy, which was often a crucial factor in determining who took the throne? Did you visit any of the places where the battles took place?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I became a researcher in military history, which is not my natural home! I visited battle sites and I read long and complicated descriptions of battles and the modern speculations. In the end I found myself absolutely intrigued and fascinated by how the battles were lost and won by small events, even sometimes by luck. The mist at Barnet is a recorded fact, and it was possible for me to weave it into the story of Elizabeth and her mother as well as to see it as a determining factor on the battlefield. The three suns of Towton were both a real phenomenon and a powerful metaphor for the troops. The history of battles is a central part to the story of the Cousins' War, and part of my task in this novel and the others in the series was to take this history, as I take any other, and make it come alive in the novel. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> The fate of Edward and Richard, the princes in the Tower, is a subject that has confounded historians for centuries. Why did you decide to approach this aspect of the story the way you did? Is there evidence to suggest that Elizabeth sent her son Richard into hiding and a page boy in his place to the Tower?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Part of my response to this story was simply emotional: I have a son of my own, and the thought of Elizabeth losing both her sons was tremendously painful. So I confess a bias to wanting at least one to survive. Then there is the historical evidence. A very interesting book by Ann Wroe, Perkin, suggested to me that the so-called pretender Perkin Warbeck might well have been the surviving prince, Richard. Her case for it is very compelling, as others have suggested too. There is other persuasive evidence that both boys were not killed as the traditional history (and Shakespeare) suggests. Even the traditional history--of them being suffocated in their beds in the Tower and buried beneath a stair--is filled with contradictions. If Perkin was Richard--and this is speculative history, as indeed all history around this genuine mystery must be--then Richard must have somehow survived. How could this have happened? It seemed to me most likely, not that he escaped from the Tower, but that he was never sent to it. His mother knew the danger her older son was in, had herself seen Henry VI murdered in the Tower, and was highly aware of the danger to her sons. It seemed to me most unlikely that she would hand over a second son when she had lost the first. The changeling page boy is my invention, but the history of Perkin in Flanders is based on his own confession. His story will continue in the series.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Elizabeth's father says to her, &#x201c;We are forming a new royal family. We have to be more royal than royalty itself or nobody will believe us. I can't say I quite believe it myself&#x201d; (page 63). How unlikely was it that Elizabeth Woodville would become queen? How has she been remembered by historians?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Elizabeth's ascent to the throne is one of the great triumphs of a commoner and was considered so exceptional in her own time that one of the explanations offered was witchcraft. It is really a triumph of unlikely events. How unlikely that Edward, raising troops for a battle, would be diverted by a woman he must have met by chance? How unlikely that he would offer marriage when he knew as well as Warwick that to secure his reign he must marry well, preferably a European princess? How unlikely that even after a secret marriage he would honor his vows? It is a catalogue of unlikely events, and the only coherent explanation is that Edward and Elizabeth fell in love at first sight and married for love. Elizabeth, like many powerful and effective women, has been unkindly treated by historians. Some follow the gossip against her at the time that begrudged her good fortune; some point to the alliances she made for her family as symptoms of greed and self-aggrandizement. She gets little credit for surviving two periods in sanctuary, nor for her courage during the siege of the Tower. She is like many women &#x201c;hidden from history&#x201d; in the phrase of historian Sheila Rowbotham, and when her role is acknowledged she is often treated with very harsh criticism.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Anthony Woodville, the queen's brother, seemed to be ahead of his time in regard to education and culture. What more can you tell us about him? Was Elizabeth honoring his memory by becoming a patroness of Queens' College Cambridge?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Elizabeth took over the role of patron of Queens' College from her predecessor Margaret of Anjou, but her interest in education and culture may have been inspired and would certainly have been encouraged by her brother, who was a true Renaissance man: spiritual, martial, thoughtful, and innovative. He brought the printer William Caxton to England and sponsored the first printed book; he was famous for his ability in the joust; and he was a loyal brother to Elizabeth and a devoted uncle to her son. The poem I quote in the book was indeed the poem he wrote the night before he died. We can only speculate as to the sort of man he can have been that he should spend his last hours on earth, not in rage or grief, but in crafting a poem of such detachment and clarity.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> If you could go back in time and live in any of the royal courts you've written about, which one would it be and why?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I would be absolutely mad to want to be a woman of any of these times. A Tudor or Plantagenet woman was wholly ruled by men: either father or husband. She would find it difficult to seek any education, make her own fortune, or improve her circumstances. Her husband would have a legal right over her that was equal to his ownership of domestic animals; and the chances of dying in childbirth were very high. If one could go back in time and be a wealthy man, these would be times of adventure and opportunity but still tremendously dangerous. I think I would prefer the Tudor period to diminish the danger of being killed in battle, but there were still regular plagues and foreign wars to face. I cannot sufficiently express my enthusiasm for modern medicine, votes for women, and safe contraception.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> The younger Elizabeth emerges as quite a vivid and spirited character. Will we be seeing more of her in a future book?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Elizabeth, the Princess of York, goes on to marry Henry VII and so is mother to a royal dynasty, just as her father and mother hoped they were creating a royal dynasty. She is, of course, mother of Henry VIII, and her granddaughter is England's greatest queen--Elizabeth I. Elizabeth of York will be the subject of the third book of this series, to be called The White Princess. But coming next is the story of the mother of Henry VII, the indomitable Margaret Beaufort, whom you may have glimpsed in this novel but who deserves a book all to herself.

She is the daughter of bestselling sci-fi author Steve Perry and lives in Portland, Oregon with her husband and two children.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <b>Claire's head hurt.</b> </p><p> She'd been half-dreaming, remembering things, until the faraway sound of thunder crowded through the dark, pulling her closer to wakefulness. She'd dreamed about the insanity that had become her life over the past few months, and even though an almost conscious part of her knew it was reality, it still seemed too incredible to be true. Flashes of what had happened in post-viral Raccoon City kept rising up, images of the inhuman creature that had stalked her and the little girl through the devastation, memories of the Birken family, of meeting Leon, of praying that Chris was all right. </p><p> Thunder again, louder, and she realized that something was wrong but couldn't seem to wake up, to stop remembering. Chris. Her brother had gone underground in Europe, and they had followed, and now she was cold and her head hurt but she didn't know why. </p><p> <i>What happened?</i> She concentrated, but it would only come in pieces, pictures and thoughts from the weeks since Raccoon City. She couldn't seem to control the memories. It was like watching a movie in a dream, and still, she couldn't wake up. </p><p> Images of Trent on the plane, and a desert, finding a disk of codes that had ultimately proved useless to her brother's cause. The long flight to London, the hop to France -- </p><p> <i>-- a telephone call, "Chris is here, he's fine." Barry Burton's voice, deep and friendly. Laughing, the incredible relief filling her up, feeling Leon's hand on her shoulder -- </i> </p><p> It was a start, and it led her to the next clear recollection -- a meeting had been set up, one of the surveillance posts for the HQ Admin wing, on Umbrella grounds. Leon and the others were waiting in the van, <i>checking my watch, heart pounding with excitement, where is he, where's Chris?</i> </p><p> Claire didn't know she was screwed until the first bullets ripped past, chasing her onto the spotlight-riddled grounds, into a building -- </p><p> <i>-- running through the corridors, deafened by the rattle of automatic weapons and the helicopter outside, running, bullets chipping by close enough to send sharpened slivers of floor tile into the meat of her calves -- </i></p><p><i> -- and an explosion, armed soldiers writhing in the blast's fury, and...and I got caught.</i> </p><p> They'd held her for over a week, trying everything they could to make her talk. She'd talked, too, about going fishing with Chris, political ideology, her favorite bands....When it came down to it, she didn't know anything vital; she was looking for her brother, that was all, and she somehow managed to convince them that she didn't know anything important about Umbrella. It probably helped that she was nineteen, and looked about as deadly as a Girl Scout. What little she actually <i>did</i> know, things about the Umbrella insider, Trent, or the whereabouts of Sherry Birken, the scientist's daughter, she buried deep and left there. </p><p> When they'd realized she was useless as an informant, she'd been taken away. Cuffed, scared, two private planes and a helicopter later, the island. She didn't even see it, they'd put a hood over her face, the stifling blackness only adding to her fear. Rockfort Island, wasn't that what the pilot called it? It was a long way from Paris, but that was the extent of her knowledge. Thunder, there was a sound of thunder. She remembered being pushed through a muddy prison cemetery in the gray morning, catching a glimpse through her stifling hood of the graves, marked with elaborate headstones. Down some stairs, welcome to your new home and <b>BOOM</b> -- </p><p> The ground was shaking, rumbling. Claire opened her eyes just in time to see the one overhead light go out, the thick metal bars of her cell suddenly imprinted in negative and floating off to her left in the pitch dark. She lay on her side on a clammy, dirty floor. </p><p> <i>Not good, nope, you better get up.</i> Steeling herself against the pounding of her skull she crawled to her knees, her muscles stiff and sore. The blackness of the cold, dank room was very still, except for the sound of water dripping, a slow and lonely sound; it appeared she was alone. </p><p> <i>Not for long. Oh, man, I'm in it deep now.</i> Umbrella had her, and considering the havoc she'd created back in Paris, it was unlikely that they were going to treat her to ice cream and send her on her way. </p><p> The renewed awareness of her situation knotted her stomach, but she did her best to put the fear aside. She needed to think straight, to figure out her options, and she needed to be ready to act. She wouldn't have survived Raccoon City if she'd given in to panic -- </p><p> <i>-- except you're on an island</i> run <i>by Umbrella. Even if you get past the guards, where can you possibly go?</i> </p><p> One predicament at a time. First thing, she should probably try to stand up. Except for the painful lump at her right temple from the asshole who'd knocked her out, she didn't think she'd been injured -- </p><p> There was another rumble, muffled and far away, and a bit of rock dust drifted down from above, she could feel it on the back of her neck. She had integrated the rumbling sounds into her half-conscious dreams as thunder, but it definitely sounded like heavy artillery had come to Rockfort. Or Godzilla. What the hell was going on out there? </p><p> She crept to her feet, wincing at her rifle-butt headache as she brushed dust off her bare arms, stretching chilled muscles. The underground room was making her wish she'd worn something warmer than jeans and a cut-off vest for her meeting with Chris -- </p><p> <i>-- Chris! Oh, please be safe!</i> In Paris, she'd deliberately led the Umbrella security team away from Leon and the others, Rebecca and the two Exeter S.T.A.R.S.; if Chris hadn't also been caught, Claire figured he'd have hooked up with the team by now. If she could get to a computer with an uplink, she should be able to send a message to Leon... </p><p> <i>...yeah, just bend those steel bars, find a couple of machine guns, and mow down the population of the island. Oh, then hack into a tightly secured relay system, assuming you can find an unmanned computer. All so you can tell Leon that you don't actually know where Rockfort is -- </i> </p><p> A louder internal voice cut in. -- <i>think positive, damnit, you can be sarcastic later, assuming you survive. What do you have to work with?</i> </p><p> Good question. There was no guard, for one thing. It was also extremely dark, a bare hint of light coming from somewhere off to the right, which could be an advantage if -- </p><p> Claire patted her pockets suddenly, wildly hoping that no one had searched her when she'd been unconscious, sure that someone must have -- left inside vest pocket, there it was! </p><p> "Idiots," she whispered, pulling out the old metal lighter that Chris had given her awhile back, the comforting weight of it warm in her hand. When they'd patted her down for weapons, a soldier reeking of tobacco had taken it out, but given it back to her when she'd said that she smoked. </p><p> Claire put the lighter back in her pocket, not wanting to blind herself now that her eyes were getting used to the dark. There was enough ambient light for her to make out most of the small room -- a desk and a couple of cabinets directly across from her cell, an open door to the left -- the same door she'd entered by -- a chair and some miscellaneous crap stacked off to the right. </p><p> <i>Okay, good, you know the environment. What else you got?</i> </p><p> Thankfully, her inner voice was a lot calmer than she was. She quickly went through her other pockets, turning up a couple of ponytail elastics and two breath mints in a crumpled roll. Terrific. Unless she wanted to take on the enemy with a very small, refreshingly peppermint slingshot, she was shit out of luck -- </p><p> Footsteps, in the corridor outside the cell room, coming closer. Her muscles tensed and her mouth went dry. She was unarmed and trapped, and the way a few of those guards had been looking at her on the transport.... </p><p> <i>...bring it on. I'm unarmed, maybe, but not defenseless.</i> If someone meant to assault her, sexually or otherwise, she'd make a point of doing some major damage in return. If she was going to die anyway, she didn't plan on going out alone. </p><p> Thump. Thump. There was only one person out there, she decided, and whoever it was, he or she was hurting. The steps were erratic and slow, shuffling, almost like... </p><p> <i>No, no way.</i> </p><p> Claire held her breath as a lone male figure stepped haltingly into the room, his arms out in front of him. He moved like one of the virus zombies, like a drunk, reeling and unsteady, and immediately staggered for the door to her cell. Reflexively, Claire backed away, terrified at the implications -- if there'd been some kind of viral outbreak on the island, at best she'd end up starving to death behind bars. </p><p> <i>And Jesus,</i> another <i>spill?</i> Thousands had died in Raccoon City. When would Umbrella learn, that their insane biological experiments weren't worth the cost? </p><p> She had to see. If it was a drunk guard, at least he was alone, she might be able to take him. And if it was a carrier, she was safe for the moment. Probably. They couldn't operate doors, or at least the ones in Raccoon hadn't been able to. She took out the lighter, flipped the top and thumbed the wheel. </p><p> Claire recognized him instantly and gasped, taking another step back. Tall and well-built, Hispanic perhaps, a mustache and dark, merciless eyes. It was the man who'd caught her back in Paris, who'd escorted her to the island. </p><p> <i>Not a zombie, at least there's that.</i> Not much of relief, but she'd take whatever she could get. </p><p> She stood for a moment, frozen, not sure what to expect. He looked different, and it was more than his dirt-smeared face or the small bloodstains on his white T-shirt. It was as though there'd been some fundamental internal change, the way his expression was set. Before, he'd looked like a stone killer. Now...now she wasn't sure, and when he reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys, she prayed that he'd changed for the better. </p><p> Without a word, he pulled the cell door open and blankly met her gaze before jerking his head to one side -- the universal sign for "get out," if there was such a thing. </p><p> Before she could act, he turned and staggered away, definitely injured from the way he held his gut with one shaking hand. There was a chair between the desk and the far wall; he sat down heavily and picked up a small bottle from the desktop with bloodstained fingers. He shook the bottle, about the size of a small spool of thread, before weakly throwing it across the room, muttering to himself. </p><p> "Perfect..." </p><p> The presumably empty bottle clattered across the cement floor, rolling to a stop just outside the cell. He glanced in her direction tiredly, his voice thick with exhaustion. "Go on. Get out of here." </p><p> Claire took a step toward the open cell door and hesitated, wondering if it was some kind of trick -- being shot trying to "escape" crossed her mind, and didn't seem all that far-fetched, considering who he worked for. She still clearly remembered the look in his eyes when he'd shoved that gun in her face, the cold sneer that had twisted his mouth. </p><p> She cleared her throat nervously, deciding to probe for an explanation. "What are you telling me, exactly?" </p><p> "You're free," he said, muttering to himself again as he sank deeper into the chair, chin lowering to his chest. "I don't know, might have been some kind of special forces team, troops were all wiped out...no chance of escape." He closed his eyes. </p><p> Her instincts told her that he really meant to let her go, but she wasn't going to take any chances. She stepped out of the cell and picked up the bottle he'd thrown, moving very slowly, watching him carefully as she approached. She didn't think his wounded act was a fake; he looked like hell, an ashy-white pallor over his dark skin, like a transparent mask. He wasn't breathing all that evenly, either, and his clothes smelled like sweat and chemical smoke. </p><p> She glanced at the bottle, an empty syringe vial with an unpronounceable name on the label, catching the word <i>hemostatic</i> in the fine print. Hemo was blood...some kind of bleeding stabilizer? </p><p> <i>Maybe an internal injury...</i>She wanted to ask him why he was releasing her, what the situation was outside, where she should go -- but she could see that he was on the verge of passing out, his eyelids fluttering. </p><p> <i>I can't just walk out, not without trying to help him -- </i></p><p><i> -- screw that! Go, go now! </i></p><p><i> He might die... </i></p><p><i> You might die! Run for it!</i> The internal dispute was brief, but her conscience triumphed over reason, as usual. He obviously hadn't set her loose because of some personal affinity, but whatever the reason, she was grateful. He didn't have to let her go, and he'd done it anyway. </p><p> "What about you?" She asked, wondering if there was anything she <i>could</i> do for him. She certainly couldn't carry him out, and she was no medic -- </p><p> "Don't worry about me," he said, raising his head to glare at her for a second, sounding irritated that she'd even brought it up. </p><p> Before she could ask him what had happened outside, he lost consciousness, his shoulders slumping, his body growing still. He was breathing, but without a doctor, she wouldn't want to bet on how long. </p><p> The lighter was getting hot, but she endured the heat long enough to search the small room, starting with the desk. There was a combat knife thrown casually on the blotter, a number of loose papers....She saw her own name on one of them and scanned the document while fixing the knife sheath to her waistband. </p><p> <i>Claire Redfield, prisoner number WKD4496, date of transfer, blah blah blah...escorted by Rodrigo Juan Raval, 3rd Security Unit CO, Umbrella Medical, Paris.</i> </p><p> Rodrigo. The man who'd caught her and set her free, and now appeared to be dying right in front of her. She couldn't do anything about it, either, not unless she could find help. </p><p> <i>Which I can't do down here,</i> she thought, snapping the overheated lighter closed after she finished the rest of her search. Nothing but junk, mostly, a trunk of musty prisoner uniforms, endless stacks of paperwork stuffed into the desk. She'd found the pair of fingerless gloves they'd taken from her, her old riding gloves, and put them on, grateful for the minor warmth they provided. All she had to defend herself with was the combat knife, a deadly weapon in the right hands...which, unfortunately, hers weren't. </p><p> <i>It's a gift horse, don't complain. Five minutes ago you were unarmed and locked up, at least now you have a chance. You should just be happy that Rodrigo didn't come down here to put you out of your misery.</i> </p><p> Still, she pretty much sucked at knifeplay. After a brief hesitation, she quickly patted Rodrigo down, but he wasn't carrying. She did find a set of keys but didn't take them, not wanting to carry anything that might draw someone's attention by jangling at the wrong moment. If she needed them, she could come back. </p><p> <i>Time to blow this Popsicle stand, see...</i></p></p><h2>Experiencing Israel: Walking with Jesus in the Holy Land</h2><p><p><b>Follow in the Footsteps of Your Savior</b><br><br> If you&#x2019;ve ever wanted to walk the streets Jesus trod or hike the hills He travelled, you can now do so... and discover the Holy Land like never before.<br><br> Explore the Holy Land from wherever you are in <i>Experiencing Israel</i> with Dr. Tony Evans<i>. </i>This guided tour of key locations in the Bible reveals the historical and spiritual significance of each place.<br><br> As you see Israel up close through the pages of this book, you will...</p><ul><li>gain a deeper understanding of the events of the Bible through the geography, history, and people of the land</li><li>gather insights that enrich your knowledge of God&#x2019;s Word and build on the spiritual foundations of your faith</li><li>feel as if you are there as you view the stunning, full-color photography throughout</li><li>find practical applications that bring the world of the Bible into your life today</li></ul><p>Whether for the first time, or all over again, take your faith journey deeper...with <i>Experiencing Israel. </i></p></p><p><p><b>Dr. Tony Evans</b> is founder and senior pastor of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, founder and president of The Urban Alternative, chaplain of the NBA&#x2019;s Dallas Mavericks, and author of <i>The Power of God&#x2019;s Names</i>, <i>Victory in Spiritual Warfare</i>, and many other books.

We&#x2019;re sitting by a fire, looking out into the mysterious night. It&#x2019;s All Hallow&#x2019;s Eve, so there&#x2019;s a chill in the wind, and the branches of the trees are bare. The stars are bright. Embers from the fire catch on the wind in bright flurries, drifting up into the yawning dark like fireflies. We are here to talk about witchcraft, about spirits, about the land. We are going to talk about the cycles of nature and what they mean. We&#x2019;ll talk about our dreams and visions. We&#x2019;ll nourish our spirits with wisdom from the old lore. Beyond the crackling fire&#x2019;s glow, the shadows lingering between the trees could almost be our ancestors. <br><br>In many ways, we are living in the golden age of witchcraft. New traditions are springing up all around us. Writers, bloggers, and vloggers share their approaches and ideas. Scholars have begun to unpack the old lore through the lens of legitimate spiritual experience. Books on the craft are published every day. These modern grammars usually share the author&#x2019;s rituals, their charms, their holidays, and provide a step-by-step approach to conducting craft workings. They try to explain what witches do, what they believe, how they conduct their rituals, what rules they should follow. Sometimes they offer a spurious account of witch history and lineage that leaves the reader more puzzled than before. These books provide much of the how, but little of the why. Pre-made models and rituals that are practiced without an understanding of their source are like cut flowers: they are beautiful on the kitchen table, but quickly wither away.<br><br> This is not that kind of book. Make no mistake; by the end of this book, you will have a treasury of charms, rituals, incantations, and practical methods by which you can conduct your craft. My larger goal, however, is to provide students of the craft with the means by which to connect with the source of witchcraft, those gates of initiation through which any witch worth his salt must pass. Because folk witchcraft is a living tradition, most of us hone and polish our craft over time. We research, experiment, and adapt. We follow the guidance of our familiar spirits. We listen to the land...</i></p><p></p><h2>The Walking Dead: Here&#39;s Negan</h2><p>Who is Negan? Since his debut in <b>THE WALKING DEAD #100</b>, the charismatic psychopath has antagonized Rick Grimes, murdered his friend with a baseball bat wrapped in barb wire (which he calls "Lucille"), and led the Saviors into war against Alexandria and the neighboring communities. <br> <br> But who was he before society broke down? That question will be answered here, collecting the <b>"HERE'S NEGAN!"</b> story originally serialized in <b>IMAGE+</b> magazine.<br><br></p><p>LIBRARY JOURNAL -- Negan is a big-time jerk. Hyperaggressive, he bullies and dominates the kids he is entrusted with as a coach. He's also cheating on his wife, who is dying of cancer. When she finally succumbs after her long battle, Negan is confronted with an unprecedented situation when she crawls off her death bed as a member of the living dead. In fact, a major zombie outbreak occurs simultaneously with her death, leaving him with no option but to fight his way out of the hospital against rampaging undead hordes. Negan discovers, however, that while the very self-centered and violent nature of his personality was problematic for navigating the rules of normal society, the very same qualities might just allow him to thrive amid the ruins of humanity's few living survivors.

Drawing upon multiple sacred texts, Hardy details the genetic engineering of humanity by Anunnaki scientist Ninmah, with the help of Enki and Hermes. She reveals how Ninmah&#x2019;s first female human creation, Tiamat/Eve, contained more alien DNA than the earlier male one, Adamu, and how the biblical Noah represents the perfection of her work. <br> <br>Examining the war between Anunnaki brothers Enki and Enlil, Hardy reveals how the concepts of sin and the inferiority of women were born out of Enlil&#x2019;s attempts to enslave and then wipe out humanity, repeatedly thwarted by Enki and Ninmah. The author further explains how the sacred sexuality taught to humans--still seen in Tantric practice--became suppressed millennia later by the patriarchal concept of original sin and how innocent Eve took the blame for the expulsion from Eden and fall from Grace. <br> <br>Showing that the god who created us was not the same god who expelled us from Eden, Hardy explains that there will be no apocalypse because the Good/Evil duality has never truly existed--it has been only enemy gods fighting and implicating humanity in the wake of their own competition for power. With a full psychological understanding of how the ancient &#x201c;gods&#x201d; have shaped humanity&#x2019;s ongoing history of conflict, we can move beyond the framework of &#x201c;(my) Good versus (your) Evil&#x201d; imposed by Enlil and begin to steer our own planetary destiny.</p><p>Chris H.

In the mind of Enlil, there was only one purpose for the lulus: to toil in place of the Nibirians, first in the gold mines and then in Sumer as servants. <br> <br>Enlil had one of the most extreme Anunnaki profiles: violent and prone to anger, indignant, jealous, and highly self-centered. He had minimal scientific or technological skills and little reflective capacity. <br> <br>For Enki--the chief scientist who had, in contrast, a powerful mind and astounding reflective capacities--it was immediately evident that such workers had to be intelligent enough to understand their tasks and that they should have the capacity to proliferate so that they were in good supply. For Ninmah too it did not make sense to keep cloning males (a task demanding huge attention, effort, and time) when nature has solved the problem of both durability and multiplication of a species by sexual reproduction. <br> <br>But, as I understand it from studying the texts, this seems to be only the baseline of Enki&#x2019;s and Ninmah&#x2019;s multilayered thinking: the official one in accordance with the assembly&#x2019;s decision to fashion workers but nevertheless anticipating future needs. <br> <br>Yet there&#x2019;s much more to Ninmah&#x2019;s and Enki&#x2019;s overall purpose, because, if they had only this aim in mind, they would have given the ability to procreate to the earthlings, but not such an open and deep intelligence that they could entrust their science to them. This is why they kept perfecting the earthlings until Adamu and Tiamat were endowed with self-awareness and the capacity to procreate. <br> <br>What is interesting is that Adamu and Tiamat, as well as the first batch of male clones of Adamu and female clones of Tiamat, had sexual organs, but they were not able to procreate until Ningishzidda performed the genetic adjustments when they were already adult. <br> <br>This is where, according to Zecharia Sitchin in his <i>The Lost Book of Enki</i>, the infamous rib comes into play. Ningishzidda first administered anesthesia to the four bodies of Ninmah, Enki, Adamu, and Tiamat. Then he extracted the life essence (DNA) of Enki from his rib&#x2019;s bone marrow and grafted it in the rib of Adamu. Similarly, he extracted the DNA of Ninmah from her rib&#x2019;s bone marrow and grafted it into the rib of Tiamat. The genome (the Tree of Life) of the first couple was thus optimized: this is the third leap in evolution. Says Sitchin, &#x201c;To their Tree of Life, two branches have been added.&#x201d; <br> <br>And this is when Tiamat and Adamu start having a sense of self and self-reflective capacities. They are now conscious of their sexuality and adorn (not &#x201c;cover&#x201d;) their loins. When Enlil, by accident, sees this, he becomes furious and expels them from Edin, despite the fact that they were in the land of Enki, nearby his city of Eridu. Sitchin says about this event: <br> <br><i>Unbeknownst to Enlil, and with the connivance of Sud [Ninmah], Enki contrived to give the creature one more genetic twist: granting to the hybrid beings . . . the ability to have offspring, the sexual &#x201c;Knowing&#x201d; for having children. The event is echoed in the biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and although the original Sumerian text of the tale has not yet been found, a number of Sumerian depictions of the event were indeed discovered. They show different aspects of the tale: the Tree of Life; the offering of the forbidden fruit; the angry encounter that ensued between the &#x201c;Lord God&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Serpent.&#x201d; Yet another shows Eve girdled in a garment around her loins while Adam is still naked, another detail related in the Book.</i> <br> <br>In this tablet Sitchin is referring to, next to the representation of Enki is written &#x201c;god who solves secrets&#x201d; or &#x201c;god of the Deep Mines&#x201d;--and in the original Hebrew text of Genesis, the &#x201c;tempter&#x201d; is called <i>Nahash</i>, which means &#x201c;serpent&#x201d; but also &#x201c;He who solves secrets,&#x201d; as well as &#x201c;he who knows metals.&#x201d; Thus the serpent in Sumerian texts is just a symbol of knowledge and wisdom--Enki being sometimes called &#x201c;The one who knows all.&#x201d; In the same way, Anu is called &#x201c;Bull of Heaven,&#x201d; and later King Richard I will get the epithet &#x201c;The Lion Heart&#x201d; to signify his bravery during the Third Crusade. We see here how an epithet representing a quality (serpent = knowledge and wisdom) is later translated into a negative quality (serpent = the tempter, the insidious scheming Satan). Yet the translation of &#x201c;god who solves secrets&#x201d; into the Hebrew was perfectly correct. Lyn Bechtel noted in her 1993 text <i>Rethinking</i>: <br> <br><i>The completely negative symbolism of the snake in the traditional [&#x201c;sin and Fall&#x201d;] interpretations is incompatible with snake symbolism in the ancient Near East and in Israel during the monarchy. Most scholars agree that this negative snake symbolism was introduced in the second or third century BCE.</i> <br> <br>The serpent as the Knower is the emblem of Enki and of two of his sons, Ningishzidda and Marduk. The Sumerian representations of Ningishzidda show already what will become his Greek emblem as Hermes&#x2019; caduceus (we will study these symbols in depth farther on). As for Marduk, he is called by Enlil &#x201c;the great Serpent&#x201d; in the second Pyramid War. <br> <br>With the genetic upgrading that took place in Edin we learn that we humans have in us the DNA of both Enki and Ninmah as well as Ningishzidda/Hermes. Could it be that, in choosing the picture of the double-helix of the DNA as an emblem for himself and Ningishzidda, Enki was signaling to all later generations of the Adamic humanity from which gods precisely we had inherited our own DNA?</p><h2>Power to the Princess: 15 Favorite Fairytales Retold with Girl Power</h2><p><b>"Brilliant." &#x2014;Kirkus Reviews, starred review<br><br> What if princesses didn&#x2019;t always marry Prince Charming and live happily ever after?

Brave, headstrong, and dreaming of being a cook, she fought to climb up from the lowest rung of the domestic-service ladder. Canny and enterprising, she worked her way to the kitchen, and discovered in herself the true talent of a chef. Sought after by New York aristocracy, and with an independence rare for a woman of the time, she seemed to have achieved the life she&#x2019;d aimed for when she arrived in Castle Garden. Then one determined &#x201c;medical engineer&#x201d; noticed that she left a trail of disease wherever she cooked, and identified her as an &#x201c;asymptomatic carrier&#x201d; of Typhoid Fever. With this seemingly preposterous theory, he made Mallon a hunted woman. <br><br>The Department of Health sent Mallon to North Brother Island, where she was kept in isolation from 1907 to 1910, then released under the condition that she never work as a cook again. Yet for Mary&#x2014;proud of her former status and passionate about cooking&#x2014;the alternatives were abhorrent. She defied the edict. <br><br>Bringing early-twentieth-century New York alive&#x2014;the neighborhoods, the bars, the park carved out of upper Manhattan, the boat traffic, the mansions and sweatshops and emerging skyscrapers&#x2014;<i>Fever </i>is an ambitious retelling of a forgotten life. In the imagination of Mary Beth Keane, Mary Mallon becomes a fiercely compelling, dramatic, vexing, sympathetic, uncompromising, and unforgettable heroine.</p><p><p><b>Julia Glass on <i>Fever</i> by Mary Beth Keane</b></p> <p><strong>How I Almost Missed Out on a New Favorite Author</strong></p> <p>Every so often, you&#x2019;ll come across a book that burns so hot and bright it&#x2019;ll sear a shadow on your vision. For a while afterwards, everything you look at will have the book&#x2019;s imprint on it; your world will be colored in the book&#x2019;s tones, and you will glimpse the book&#x2019;s characters on the street and feel your heart knocking in your chest for a few blocks, as if you&#x2019;d escaped a close call.</p> <p>I did not deliberately choose to read Mary Beth Keane&#x2019;s first novel, <i>The Walking People</i>. It came to me in a blizzard of books I read as one of three judges for a literary prize back in 2010. I took my responsibility seriously, even primly; one thing that worried me was how strongly my personal biases would influence my choices. (Was I supposed to be impartial? Of course not. But any passionately written book deserves enormous respect.)</p> <p> So here is where I admit that I was barely a few pages into <i>The Walking People</i> when my heart sank. I recognized it as a story involving Irish immigrants to America. Just then, I happened to be weary of immigrant stories in general, nor did it help that I had recently, belatedly, read the incomparable <i>Angela&#x2019;s Ashes</i>. And&#x2014;second confession&#x2014;I was raised by a mother with Scots-Presbyterian roots who had tainted my generally egalitarian self with her lifelong grudge against Irish Catholics. As I knew all too well, the most traumatic bullying she&#x2019;d experienced as a child came from Catholic schoolmates&#x2014;who taunted the Protestants as destined for hell because they couldn&#x2019;t go to confession. But I digress.</p> <p> I had vowed to read at least 50 pages of every book I was to judge, so I took <i>The Walking People</i> with me on an overnight trip I made alone, to give a talk. Perhaps the only way to keep my promise to this book would be to hold myself hostage to it in a hotel&#x2014;with nothing for diversion but the bedside Bible and the cable listings. That night, I went to bed without reading, exhausted; in the morning, I decided to hang out with the dreaded book until 9:00 a.m. or so, just to avoid rush-hour traffic. Sighing, I opened it. When I next looked up at the clock, it was 11:15, past checkout time. I had lost not only my connection to real time but very nearly an extra night in hotel fees.</p> <p>I drove home, stashed my suitcase, and plunged back into the book. Every so often I&#x2019;d flip to the end and look at the author&#x2019;s photo. How on earth did this fresh-faced young woman&#x2014;from my middle-aged perspective, this <i>girl</i>&#x2014;know so damn much about so many things? I&#x2019;ll skip all the exquisite historic and cultural details of that novel. What Mary Beth Keane knows best, and most remarkably, is how the human heart grows, changes, and endures. She seems to know intimately every stage of life, from childhood through sexual awakening, through long marriages and parenthood, through working lives filled with compromise, through the mental dwindlings of old age.</p> <p>Out of more than a hundred accompished books, I and my fellow judges named <i>The Walking People</i> one of the top five contenders for the PEN/Hemingway Prize. At the ceremony, I met Mary Beth, and I asked what her next act would be. Later, I paused to wonder: Wait. Did she really say, &#x201c;A novel about Typhoid Mary&#x201d;? (Okay, so maybe my hearing is starting to go. The room was awfully crowded.)</p> <p>Last year, finally, I read <i>Fever</i>. And you might say I read it in a fever&#x2014;the fever of emotional suspense that makes all the best books so essential. Does it involve Irish immigrants? Yes. Did I give a hoot? No. Mary Mallon is a show-stopping, strong-willed, heartbreaking heroine, and the New York in which she lived a hundred years ago comes stunningly alive as the backdrop for the story of her long and rich but star-crossed life.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s something I know firsthand: second novels that follow prizewinning firsts are tough. They&#x2019;re tough to write, tough to send out into the world. But <i>Fever</i> is even more ambitious, beguiling, and moving than <i>The Walking People</i>. Mary Beth has outdone herself. And now, of course, I have to find out what in the world she&#x2019;ll conjure up next. This time I&#x2019;ll trust my hearing. Already I can&#x2019;t wait to read it.</p>Mary Beth Keane&nbsp;attended Barnard College and the University of Virginia, where she received an MFA.

Many of the top attractions are within easy reach of Highway 101, but others are accessible only by trail. To help you explore both the civilized and the wild parts of Oregon's spectacular shore, this book blends two kinds of guides -- a detailed Travel Guide for touring by car and a complete Trail Guide for planning adventures on foot. The updated 4th edition of this popular guide starts with a full-color 32-page overview of the Oregon Coast's highlights, including lighthouses, parks, towns, and museums, with color guides to wildflowers, birds, campgrounds, cabins, and bed &amp; breakfast inns.</p><p>William L. Sullivan is the author of 18 books and numerous articles about Oregon, including an Oregon Trails column for the Eugene Register-Guard and Salem Statesman-Journal. A fifth-generation Oregonian, Sullivan began hiking at the age of five and has been exploring new trails ever since. After receiving an English degree from Cornell University and studying at Germany&#39;s Heidelberg University, he earned an M.A. from the University of Oregon. In 1985 Sullivan set out to investigate Oregon&#39;s wilderness on a 1,361-mile solo backpacking trek from the state&#39;s westernmost shore at Cape Blanco to Oregon&#39;s easternmost point in Hells Canyon. His journal of that two-month adventure, published as Listening for Coyote, was chosen one of Oregon&#39;s 100 Books. He and his wife Janell live in Eugene, but spend summers in a log cabin they built by hand on a roadless stretch of a river in Oregon&#39;s Coast Range.Hike #7, Tillamook Head <p>Easy (to Indian Beach) 3 miles round-trip 400 feet elevation gain </p> <p>Moderate (to WW II bunker) 3.9-mile loop 900 feet elevation gain </p> <p>Difficult (shuttle across headland) 6.1 miles one-way 1350 feet elevation gain </p> <p>Tillamook Head rises 1000 feet from the ocean, with jagged capes and rocky islands. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed this formidable headland in 1806 to buy the blubber of a stranded whale from Indians at Cannon Beach. At a viewpoint along the way Clark marveled, "I behold the grandest and most pleasing prospect which my eyes ever surveyed." </p> <p>The headland itself is a tilted remnant of a massive, 15-million-year-old Columbia River basalt flow. Incredibly, the lava welled up near Idaho, flooded down the Columbia Gorge, and spread along the seashore to this point. </p> <p>From Highway 101, take the north exit for Cannon Beach and follow Ecola State Park signs, keeping right for 2 miles to the park's entrance booth. A day-use parking fee is collected here. For an easy 3-mile hike suitable for hikers with children, turn left at the booth and head for the Ecola Point picnic area. As you enter the parking lot, look for a trail sign on the right. The path that starts here climbs around scenic bluffs past 3 of the best viewpoints in the park. After 1.5 miles a left-hand spur drops to Indian Beach, a good turnaround point. Ahead, the main trail bridges Canyon Creek to the Indian Beach picnic area parking lot. </p> <p>For the longer hikes at Tillamook Head it's best to start at the Indian Beach picnic area. Drive there by turning right at the park's fee booth for 1.5 miles. </p> <p>This trail starts as an old gated road on the right-hand side of the Indian Beach parking turnaround. After 100 yards keep left at a fork and climb, steeply at times, through old-growth spruce and alder woods. Wear boots, as there are a few slippery spots. After 1.6 miles turn left at a trail crossing near a primitive camping area for backpackers. In another 0.2 mile you'll find the dark, 6-room concrete bunker, which housed a radar installation in World War II. Just beyond is a cliff-edge viewpoint, breathtakingly high above a rugged rock beach. </p> <p>A mile to sea is Tillamook Rock, a bleak island with a lighthouse that operated from 1881 to 1957. Nicknamed "Terrible Tilly," the light was repeatedly overswept by winter storms that dashed water, rocks, and fish into the lantern room 150 feet above normal sea level. The island was finally bought by funereal entrepreneurs who bring in urns of cremated remains by helicopter. </p> <p>If you're ready to return on the loop to your car, simply walk back from the viewpoint to the trail crossing and go straight on a well-graded abandoned road 1.6 miles downhill to the Indian Beach parking lot. </p> <p>If you'd prefer to continue across Tillamook Head, turn left at the trail crossing. The trail climbs and dips for 2.6 miles, passing some excellent views north (including the one Clark liked), before switchbacking down through the forest 1.7 miles to a parking area at the end of Sunset Boulevard. </p> <p>To find this northern trailhead, drive Highway 101 to Seaside's southernmost traffic signal, turn west on Avenue U for two blocks and turn left on Edgewood (which becomes Sunset) for 1.2 miles to road's end. </p> <p>OTHER HIKING OPTIONS You can skip Ecola State Park's day-use fee by starting at the Sunset Boulevard trailhead and hiking the other way across Tillamook Head. Another free option is to park in Cannon Beach. Simply walk north along the park's entrance road 0.9 mile, and take a well-marked but little-used 1.1-mile trail to the entrance booth. This path often parallels the road, but passes 2 nice viewpoints.</p></p><h2>Adventures in Brambly Hedge: The gorgeously illustrated children&#x2019;s classics delighting kids and parents for over 40 years!</h2><p><p>Step into the miniature world of Brambly Hedge in this exquisite slipcase containing four classic picture books!</p><p>The mice of Brambly Hedge have many adventures but they always have time for fun too.

One of the essential practices of permaculture is to develop perennial agricultural systems that thrive over several decades without expensive and harmful inputs: perennial plant guilds, food forests, agroforestry, and mixed animal and woody species polycultures.</p> <p>The massive degradation of conventional agriculture and the environmental havoc it creates has never been as all pervasive in terms of scale, so it has become a global necessity to further the understanding of a comprehensive design and planning system such as permaculture that works with nature, not against it. The guild concept often used is one of a &#x201c;functional relationship&#x201d; between plants&#x2013;beneficial groupings of plants that share functions in order to bring health and stability to a plant regime and create an abundant yield for our utilization. In other words, it is the integration of species that creates a balanced, healthy, and thriving ecosystem. But it goes beyond integration. A guild is a metaphor for all walks of life, most importantly a group of people working together to craft works of balance, beauty, and utility.</p> <p>This book is the first, and most comprehensive, guide about plant guilds ever written, and covers in detail both what guilds are and how to design and construct them, complete with extensive color photography and design illustrations. Included is information on:<br> <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we can observe about natural plant guilds in the wild and the importance of observation;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detailed research on the structure of plant guilds, and a portrait of an oak tree (a guild unto itself);<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal interactions with plant guilds;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steps to guild design, construction, and dynamics: from assessment to design to implementation;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen detailed plant guilds, five each from the three authors based on their unique perspectives;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guild project management: budgets, implementation, management, and maintenance.<br> <br> Readers of any scale will benefit from this book, from permaculture designers and professional growers, to backyard growers new to the concept of permaculture. Books on permaculture cover this topic, but never in enough depth to be replicable in a serious way.

He doesn&#x2019;t know whose side he&#x2019;s on or who he can trust. With his pursuers closing in on every side, Charlie makes his way back to his hometown to find some answers. There, holed up in an abandoned mansion, he&#x2019;s joined by his&nbsp;friends in a desperate attempt to discover&nbsp;the truth about a murder he can't remember&#x2014;and the love he can never forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p>Andrew Klavan was hailed by Stephen King as &#x201c;the most original novelist of crime and suspense since Cornell Woolrich.&#x201d; He is the recipient of two Edgar Awards and the author of such bestsellers as True Crime, Don&#x2019;t Say a Word, and Empire of Lies.Gr 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;In this fast-paced sequel to The Last Thing I Remember, Charlie West is a fugitive on a mission to discover the truth about the year he can't remember. He heads home to search for some answers after a harrowing escape from both the police, who believe he murdered his friend Alex, and a terrorist group known as the Homelanders, who believe he has betrayed them. While the book begins mid-action, his backstory is provided through flashbacks and first-person inner monologues, allowing the audience to be brought up to speed quickly. Covert interactions with his friends also offer glimpses into his lost year, providing both Charlie and the listeners with clues that could help solve the mystery of his past. While the intense, thrilling narrative will keep the audience on the edge of its seat, it's Charlie himself who propels the story. Passionate and loyal, he loves his country and God, and while his patriotism and religious conviction could have come across as over-the-top, they instead make him more realistic; his beliefs are a large part of who he is and what motivates him, yet they don't define him. Narrator Joshua Swanson's well-modulated voice perfectly conveys Charlie and his struggles as he fights to clear his name, and his youthful sound lends authenticity to the performance. Action-packed and suspenseful, the audiobook will have listeners eagerly anticipating the next installment.&#x2014;Audrey Sumser, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Mayfield, OH</p><h2>Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR&#39;s Great Supreme Court Justices</h2><p>A tiny, ebullient Jew who started as America's leading liberal and ended as its most famous judicial conservative.

A backcountry lawyer who started off trying cases about cows and went on to conduct the most important international trial ever. A self-invented, tall-tale Westerner who narrowly missed the presidency but expanded individual freedom beyond what anyone before had dreamed. <br> <br> Four more different men could hardly be imagined. Yet they had certain things in common. Each was a self-made man who came from humble beginnings on the edge of poverty. Each had driving ambition and a will to succeed. Each was, in his own way, a genius. <br> <br> They began as close allies and friends of FDR, but the quest to shape a new Constitution led them to competition and sometimes outright warfare. SCORPIONS tells the story of these four great justices: their relationship with Roosevelt, with each other, and with the turbulent world of the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War. It also serves as a history of the modern Constitution itself.<br><br></p><p>Noah Feldman is the author of four previous books: <i>The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State</i> (Princeton University Press, 2008), <i>Divided By God</i> (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2005); <i>What We Owe Iraq</i> (Princeton University Press, 2004); and <i>After Jihad </i>(Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2003)."Scorpions is a deft and sophisticated panoramic history of a fascinating era, an important one of Supreme Court jurisprudence, told simply without losing substance . . . Through excellent storytelling and absorbing case histories about interesting, ambitious men grappling with profound and complicated issues-and with each other-Feldman's approach will satisfy constitutional scholars as well as inform readers in the general public. His broad canvas is both accessible and thoughtful."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Washington Lawyer<br></em></i></b><br><br>"By so personifying competing modes of constitutional interpretation, Feldman, a law professor, elevates the story from specialty to general interest and, to boot, embroiders technicalities about original intent and the like with animosities that roiled the quartet . . . Taking readers into the conference room, Feldman shows this unpolished side of the Supreme Court in cases of the 1940s, culminating in his account about how Frankfurter achieved unanimity in the landmark desegregation case of Brown v. Board of Education. The interpersonal factor in court politics is knowledgeably displayed in Feldman's intriguing account."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Booklist</em></i></b><br><br>"The pleasure of this book comes from Feldman's skill as a narrator of intellectual history. With confidence and an eye for telling details he relates the story of the backstage deliberations . . . Feldman is especially good in describing how the clashing personalities and philosophies of his four protagonists were reflected in their negotiations and final opinions . . . This is a first-rate work of narrative history that succeeds in bringing the intellectual and political battles of the post-Roosevelt Court vividly to life."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br>"Of Franklin Roosevelt's nine Supreme Court appointments, four have had lasting influence ... Feldman neatly demonstrates how their careers and personal histories accounted for their mutual resentments and shaped their distinctive approaches to constitutional interpretation. Frankfurter's judicial restraint, Black's originalism, Jackson's pragmatism and Douglas's realism-four interpretive doctrines that continue to reverberate-are fleshed out in accessible discussions of important cases dealing with presidential power and civil rights. The process of how they put aside personal differences and individual philosophies to reach agreement in the historic Brown v. Board of Education is only part of the author's revealing exploration.<br><br>An immensely readable history that goes behind the fa�ade of our most august institution to reveal the flesh-and-blood characters who make our laws."<br><br>&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus </em>(Starred Review)<br></i></b><br><br>"Noah Feldman's book is more than a fascinating group biography of four complicated, brilliant, and ambitious men, and more than a precise and illuminating account of liberalism and Constitutional law. It's also a window on history-from Sacco and Vanzetti and the Great Depression to Pearl Harbor, the Nuremberg Trials, the Cold War, and the Civil Rights Movement. There is adventure on every page."&#x2015;<b><i>Louis Menand, author of <em>The Metaphysical Club</em></i></b><br><br>"In this splendid biography, Noah Feldman sets out to tell the story of the making of the modern Constitution-and thus of modern America itself-through the lives of Franklin Roosevelt and four of his Supreme Court justices. The result is a terrific tale of politics and principle, personality and vision. The battles of these four 'scorpions' gave us our world, and Feldman's excellent book is a powerful and original contribution to our understanding of the 20th century-and of our own."<br><br>&#x2015;<b><i>Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize winning author of <em>American Lion</em></i></b><br>"FDR appointed larger-than-life characters to the Supreme Court, and SCORPIONS brings them vividly to life - and reminds us why, strangely enough, they matter today more than ever."&#x2015;<b><i>Jeffrey Toobin, author of <em>The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Cou</em>rt</i></b></p><h2>A Chair for Yoga: A complete guide to Iyengar Yoga practice with a chair</h2><p>This practical guide will show you how to improve and enrich your practice of Iyengar Yoga using a chair. � <b>Beginning practitioners</b> will learn how to do the poses with less effort and better alignment. � <b>Intermediate practitioners </b>will learn to extend the range and duration of the poses safely � <b>Advanced practitioners</b> will deepen and develop their practice of advanced poses � <b>Teachers</b> will gain useful and enjoyable ideas to enrich their classes.</p><p>Eyal Shifroni is a Senior Iyengar Yoga teacher with more than 25 years of teaching experience.

From an early age, Eileen wished that she lived somewhere else. She sets her sights on upper class Bronxville, New York, and an American Dream is born.<br> <br>Driven by this longing, Eileen places her stock and love in Ed Leary, a handsome young scientist, and with him begins a family. Over the years Eileen encourages her husband to want more: a better job, better friends, a better house. It slowly becomes clear that his growing reluctance is part of a deeper, more incomprehensive psychological shift. An inescapable darkness enters their lives, and Eileen and Ed and their son Connell try desperately to hold together a semblance of the reality they have known, and to preserve, against long odds, an idea they have cherished of the future.<br> <br>Described by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> as &#x201c;A long, gorgeous epic, full of love and caring...one of the best novels you&#x2019;ll read this year,&#x201d; <i>We Are Not Ourselves </i>is a testament to our greatest desires and our greatest frailties.

What&#x2019;s special about this book is how Thomas takes us, slowly and somewhat unexpectedly, deep inside a family battling the gray-toned middling place of their middle-class existence. At the core is Eileen Tumulty Leary, urging her complacent husband and their impressionable son forward. Along the way, lives come and go. (&#x201c;Fair enough,&#x201d; her mother said, and in a little while she was dead.) There are some gorgeous scenes, some taut lines (I liked the air-conditioning unit&#x2019;s &#x201c;indefatigable wind&#x201d;), and some heartbreakers (a mother tells her son, at the funeral home, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s probably enough&#x201d;). It&#x2019;s thrilling to see an emerging writer test and flex his voice. Eileen and her husband are &#x201c;coconspirators in a mission of normalcy&#x201d;; in truth, there&#x2019;s occasionally too much normalcy in these 600 pages. Then again, it&#x2019;s oddly addictive to watch this family unfold, age, and devolve. Intimate, honest, and true, it&#x2019;s the story of a doomed father and a flawed son and the indefatigable and loving woman who keeps them all together, even as they&#x2019;re falling apart. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p>Matthew Thomas was born in the Bronx and grew up in Queens.

When her ex-husband killed himself soon after their divorce, her world&#x2014;and that of her children&#x2014;was shattered. Though she held a very public position with one of the world&#x2019;s largest media companies, she was hesitant to speak about the personal trauma that she and her family experienced following his death. A woman who addresses the public regularly on intimate health topics, she was uncertain of revealing her devastating loss&#x2014;the most painful thing she&#x2019;d ever experienced. But with the high-profile suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, Dr. Ashton recognized the importance of talking about her experience and the power of giving voice to her grief. She shared her story with her <em>Good Morning America</em> family on air&#x2014;an honest, heartbreaking revelation that provided comfort and solace to others, like her and her family, who have been left behind. </p><p>In <em>Life After Suicide</em>, she opens up completely for the first time, hoping that her experience and words can inspire those faced with the unthinkable to persevere. Part memoir and part comforting guide that incorporates the latest insights from researchers and health professionals, <em>Life After Suicide</em> is both a call to arms against this dangerous, devastating epidemic, and an affecting story of personal grief and loss. In addition, Dr. Ashton includes stories from others who have survived the death of a loved one by their own hand, showing how they survived the unthinkable and demonstrating the vital roles that conversation and community play in recovering from the suicide of a loved one. The end result is a raw and revealing exploration of a subject that&#x2019;s been taboo for far too long, providing support, information, and comfort for those attempting to make sense of their loss and find a way to heal.&nbsp; </p></p><p><p>From the outside, Jennifer Ashton, M.D., had it all together: two loving children, an amicable family-focused relationship with her recent ex-husband, Rob, and a flourishing career as a privately practicing Ob-Gyn and as ABC&#x2019;s Chief Medical Correspondent, a regular presence on <em>Good Morning America</em>. But after Rob&#x2019;s unexpected suicide, her life as she had known it was shattered.</p><p>Suicide is at once a deeply personal trauma, and a devastating public epidemic that affects millions, between the people who die by suicide, and those who are left behind. Despite her regular national reporting on intimate health issues, Dr. Ashton&#x2019;s own experience with loss felt too raw and even too frightening to speak of before the high-profile suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain. It was then that she realized the importance and the timeliness of sharing her story, and confronting her own stigma and vulnerability to try to help others work through their grief as survivors.</p>In this affecting story of personal loss and of the indefinite process of recovery, Dr. Ashton utilizes community and conversation to elucidate the process of grieving and finding peace after suicide. Both a memoir and a practical guide to helping others through this tragedy, <em>Life After Suicide</em> offers support, advice, and hope to those whose wounds will always be raw, and bravely explores a subject that has been taboo for far too long. Combining the most current wisdom of experts and the heart-wrenching stories of other survivors (including her children), the end result is an eloquent look into suicide and a hopeful expression of what it means&#x2014;and ultimately, what it takes&#x2014;to heal, in a way that honors the spirit of those who have died, without allowing blame, anger, and resentment to take over. <em>Life After Suicide</em> is an honest and insightful look into surviving a loved one&#x2019;s suicide&#x2014;and in finding the courage to continue after unimaginable loss. With the tragic likelihood being that many people will eventually know of someone who dies by suicide, <em>Life After Suicide</em> is a window into a world that we all truly need to start to understand, without shame, stigma, or bias.<p>Jennifer Ashton, M.D., is the Chief Medical Correspondent for ABC News, and an ob-gyn in private practice.

But there is also a long tradition, intensified in recent decades, of thinking about music as a product of the human mind. Whether considering composition, performance, listening, or appreciation, the constraints and capabilities of the human mind play a formative role. The field that has emerged around this approach is known as the psychology of music. <br><br>Written in a lively and accessible manner, this volume connects the science to larger questions about music that are of interest to practicing musicians, music therapists, musicologists, and the general public alike. For example: Why can one musical performance move an audience to tears, and another compel them to dance, clap, or snap along? How does a "hype" playlist motivate someone at the gym? And why is that top-40 song stuck in everyone's head? <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

We all like to think of ourselves as clear-headed and logical - but all readers will find in this book fallacies of which they themselves are guilty. The author shows you how to simultaneously strengthen your own thinking and identify the weaknesses in other people arguments. And, more mischievously, Pirie also shows how to be deliberately illogical - and get away with it.

This book guides students through hands-on experience with computer-based experiment equipment, video analysis of motions, and real-world applications of physics concepts. This lab guide gives step-by-step instructions about how to use the common measurement software Logger Pro, the hardware LabQuest 2 and the most common Vernier sensors, and the video analysis program ImageJ/Fiji to take measurements.

So opens this singular and wise testimony. Like all poets, inspired by death, Thomas Lynch is, unlike others, also hired to bury the dead or to cremate them and to tend to their families in a small Michigan town where he serves as the funeral director.</p><p>In the conduct of these duties he has kept his eyes open, his ear tuned to the indispensable vernaculars of love and grief. In these twelve pieces his is the voice of both witness and functionary. Here, Lynch, poet to the dying, names the hurts and whispers the condolences and shapes the questions posed by this familiar mystery. So here is homage to parents who have died and to children who shouldn't have. Here are golfers tripping over grave markers, gourmands and hypochondriacs, lovers and suicides. These are the lessons for life our mortality teaches us.</p></p><p>"...I had come to know that the undertaking that my father did had less to do with what was done to the dead and more to do with what the living did about the fact of life that people died," Thomas Lynch muses in his preface to <i>The Undertaking</i>. The same could be said for Lynch's book: ostensibly about death and its attendant rituals, <i>The Undertaking</i> is in the end about life. In each case, he writes, it is the one that gives meaning to the other. A funeral director in Milford, Michigan, Lynch is that strangest of hyphenates, a poet-undertaker, but according to Lynch, all poets share his occupation, "looking for meaning and voices in life and love and death." Looking for meaning takes him to all sorts of unexpected places, both real and imagined. He embalms the body of his own father, celebrates the rebuilt bridge to his town's old cemetery, takes issue with the Jessica Mitfords of this world, and envisages a "golfatorium," a combination golf course and cemetery that could restore joy to the last rites. In "Crapper," Lynch even contemplates the subtleties of the modern flush toilet and its relationship to the messy business of dying: "Just about the time we were bringing the making of water and the movement of bowels into the house, we were pushing the birthing and marriage and sickness and dying out." Death and fatherhood, death and friendship, death and faith and love and poetry--these are the concerns that power Lynch's undertaking. Throughout, Lynch pleads the case for our dead--who are, after all, still living through us--with an eloquence marked by equal parts whimsy, wit, and compassion. In the last essay, "Tract," he envisions almost wistfully the funeral he'd choose for himself, and then relinquishes that, too. Funerals, after all, are for the living. The dead, he reminds us, don't care. <i>--Mary Park</i>Thomas Lynch has authored five collections of poetry, one of stories, and four books of essays. His first, The Undertaking, won the Heartland Prize for Non-Fiction and the American Book Award, and was a finalist for the National Book Award. His writing has appeared in the Atlantic, Granta, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, and the New York Times, among other publications. He works as a funeral director in Milford, Michigan, and teaches at the Bear River Writer&#x2019;s Conference.</p><h2>Happiness 101 (previously published as When Likes Aren't Enough): Simple Secrets to Smart Living &amp; Well-Being</h2><p><b><i>Are you as authentically happy as your social media profiles make it seem?</i></b><br><br>When a group of researchers asked young adults around the globe what their number one priority was in life, the top answer was "happiness." Not success, fame, money, looks, or love...but happiness. For a rising generation of young adults raised as digital natives in a fast-paced, ultra-connected world, authentic happiness still seems just out of reach. While social media often shows well-lit selfies and flawless digital personas, today's 16 to 25-year-olds are struggling to find real meaning, connection, and satisfaction right alongside their overburdened parents. <br><br><i>Happiness 101 </i>tackles the ever-popular subject of happiness and well-being, but reframes it for a younger reader struggling with Instagram envy and high-stakes testing, college rejections and helicopter parents. Professor of positive psychology Dr. Tim Bono distills his most popular college course on the science of happiness into creative, often counterintuitive, strategies for young adults to lead happier, more fulfilling lives. <br><br>Filled with exciting research, practical exercises, honest advice, and quotes and stories from young adults themselves, <i>Happiness 101</i> is a master class for a generation looking for science-backed, real-world ways to feel just a little bit happ<i>ier</i> every day.</p><p><b>Tim Bono, PhD </b>is a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. He has won several teaching awards and thousands of students have taken his popular courses on the Psychology of Young Adulthood and the Science of Happiness. He is an expert consultant on psychological health and happiness for a number of national media outlets, including <i>CNN, Fast Company, The Associated Press</i>, and several public radio stations. This is his first book. <br>"This is one of the best books I've read that offers practical solutions for the mental health crisis. This should be required reading not only for students and higher education professionals, but for anyone who is interested in adopting healthier habits in their own lives. A must read!" <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Dr. Amelia Parnell, vice president for research and policy at NASPA-Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education</i></b><br><br>"There are so many things to pull out of this book even beyond strategies to achieve happiness-Bono shows readers how they can make many choices that lead to a healthier lifestyle overall. His students' stories powerfully bring the research into practice." <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Dr. Beth Lingren Clark, assistant dean and director of first-year programs at University of Minnesota</i></b></p><h2>When Life Hurts: Finding Hope and Healing from the Pain You Carry</h2><p>We all experience emotional pain--and even devastation--in our lives, but few of us know how to deal with it properly.

In a story written in exquisite prose and told from multiple perspectives&#x2014;including Ann, Wade, and Jenny, now in prison&#x2014;we gradually learn of the mysterious and shocking act that fractured Wade and Jenny's lives, of the love and compassion that brought Ann and Wade together, and of the memories that reverberate through the lives of every character in<i>&nbsp;Idaho</i>.<br><br>In a wild emotional and physical landscape, Wade&#x2019;s past becomes the center of Ann&#x2019;s imagination, as Ann becomes determined to understand the family she never knew&#x2014;and to take responsibility for them, reassembling their lives, and her own.<br><br><b>FINALIST FOR: International Dylan Thomas Prize � Edgar First Novel Award � Young Lions Fiction Award</b> <br><br>&#x201c;You know you&#x2019;re in masterly hands here.

Henry Award for her story &#x201c;Owl.&#x201d;2004<br><br>They never drove the truck, except once or twice a year to get firewood. It was parked just up the hill in front of the woodshed, where it collected rain in the deep dents on the hood and mosquito larvae in the rainwater. That was the way it was when Wade was married to Jenny, and that&#x2019;s the way it is now that he is married to Ann.<br><br>Ann goes up there sometimes to sit in the truck. She waits until Wade is busy, so that he won&#x2019;t notice that she&#x2019;s gone. Today, she comes here under the pretense of getting firewood, dragging a blue sled over the mud and grass and patches of snow. The woodshed isn&#x2019;t far from the house, but it&#x2019;s hidden from view by a stand of ponderosa pines. She feels like she is trespassing, like none of this is hers to see.<br><br>The truck is parked on a rare space of flat land, an unlikely shelf carved into the mountainside. In front of the woodshed, around the truck, a few loose bricks lie here and there in the grass and snow. Spindles of mangled wire lean against the trees. Hanging from a long larch limb are two thick ropes that sway opposite each other now, but look as if they might have once been connected by a flat board&#x2014;�a child&#x2019;s swing.<br><br>It is March, sunny and cold. Ann gets into the driver&#x2019;s seat and shuts the door quietly. She pulls the seatbelt across her body, then rolls the window down so that several droplets splatter on her lap. She touches the wet spots with her fingertip, connecting them with lines in her mind to make a picture on her thigh. The picture reminds her of a mouse, or at least a child&#x2019;s drawing of a mouse, with a triangle face and a long, curlicued tail. Nine years ago, when Wade was still married to Jenny and both of his daughters were still alive, a mouse had crawled along the top of the truck&#x2019;s exhaust pipe into the engine compartment, and built its nest on the manifold. She thinks of how strange it is that Wade probably remembers that mouse, remembers the sound of it skittering under the hood, and yet he&#x2019;s forgotten his first wife&#x2019;s name. Or so it seems sometimes. But the mouse&#x2014;�the mouse is still very much alive in his memory.<br><br>A few years after Ann and Wade married, Ann found a pair of deerskin gloves in a toolbox high on a shelf in a closet. They were much nicer than the work gloves Wade usually wore, and seemed to be brand new except for the odor of something burned. That was how she learned about the mouse in the first place. She asked why he kept the gloves stored in their closet instead of using them. Wade told her that he wanted to preserve the smell.<br><br>What smell is that?<br><br>The smell of a rodent&#x2019;s nest that caught on fire.<br><br>The last smell in his daughter&#x2019;s hair.<br><br>It was a long time ago now that he said things like that. He stopped talking about the details of his daughter&#x2019;s death once he saw how much Ann held on to them. He probably thinks she&#x2019;s forgotten about the gloves, it&#x2019;s been so many years. But she hasn&#x2019;t. He keeps them in the filing cabinet with his papers, in his office upstairs. She has opened the drawer just enough to see them.<br><br>That mouse had probably been in the truck the whole winter, during that last year that Wade was married to Jenny, that last year that May was alive and June was safe. Ann thinks of the mouse going back and forth in the snow between the truck and the barn, hauling mouthfuls of hay or insulation or tufts of stuffing from the dogs&#x2019; beds, making its nest bigger and having babies in it once spring arrived. Some of the babies probably died early on and were absorbed by the nest, their tiny bones like shards of straw themselves. And other mice came, too; you could hear them moving under the hood if you put your ear against it. The little girls liked doing that.<br><br>Well, at least Ann imagines they did.<br><br>One day in August, the whole family got into the truck. Wade at the steering wheel, where Ann is sitting now, Jenny next to him, their daughters, June and May, nine and six, crammed in back with a jug of lemonade and Styrofoam cups, which they carved pictures into with their fingernails. The girls probably wanted to ride in the truck bed, but their mother would have said it was not safe on the highway. So they sat facing each other in the cab with their backs against the windows, bumping their knees, probably fighting.<br><br>They forgot all about the mice. They didn&#x2019;t notice anything at first, driving slowly over the dirt roads. But once they reached the highway in their town of Ponderosa, a smell like decay and burning hair, skin and seeds sizzling on a hot engine, entered through the vent and filled the whole cab of the truck until the little girls were gagging and laughing and pushing their freckled noses out their windows.<br><br>They had to drive on with their windows down, tolerating the smell, for the hour drive through the Nez Valley, past Athol and Careywood, then up the long road nearly to the top of Loeil, the mountain where the birch wood was already cut and piled, ready to be loaded. Their hair and clothes, and Wade&#x2019;s gloves, held the burned smell in their fibers. Ann pictures June and May. They wait in the sun while their mother rolls the birch logs onto the truck bed and their father stacks them there. The girls lean against the tires, slapping horseflies on their legs, pouring lemonade into the dust.<br><br>The smell would have been there on the way back, too. It is the one constant. It connects two things in Ann&#x2019;s mind that she can&#x2019;t manage to connect otherwise&#x2014;�the drive up the mountain and the drive back down. The drive back down is the part Ann comes here to try to understand.<br><br>There would have been things Wade had to consider, before he could take control and go for help. Practical things. Shutting the tailgate, for example, so the logs wouldn&#x2019;t roll out. He would have had to remember to hold the handle up and then push in&#x2014;�there was a trick to it&#x2014;�in order to lock the tailgate. That he would remember, that his fingers could do what they were supposed to do even in the midst of his horror, has something to do with the reason Ann loves him. One day, perhaps, everything will be gone from his mind except the trick of the tailgate latch, and Ann will love him still.<br><br>She thinks of how easy it would have been to get lost on the way back down, since they&#x2019;d gotten lost so badly on the way up. How could anything have looked familiar? The narrow, grassy roads. The crudely made road signs nailed to trees: That he had read them an hour before seemed impossible to her. All of it seemed impossible. The summer sky, the snapping of twigs under the truck&#x2019;s tires. The smell of grease and honeysuckle. Jenny&#x2019;s breath fogging the window.<br><br>Ann has had to imagine most of it, everything beyond the facts Wade told her or she heard on TV. She did try very hard during those early days to keep the radio and TV off, so that everything she knew she knew from Wade. What Wade wanted to tell her, she would keep. But she wouldn&#x2019;t let herself go searching; she wouldn&#x2019;t let herself ask.<br><br>But all of that is different now that Wade is forgetting. She wants to ask him if he and Jenny spoke, before his memory is lost for good. Did Jenny look out the side window or straight ahead? Or did she look at him?<br><br>At what point did he rip down the rearview mirror?<br><br>No, Ann thinks, it isn&#x2019;t even the drive back. It is his getting into the truck at all. Opening the door and getting in. Jenny there with the cup of lemonade shaking in her hand&#x2014;�or maybe not shaking, maybe perfectly still. Maybe the cup empty. Maybe the lemonade spilled on her lap like the droplets of water now on Ann&#x2019;s thigh, in the shape of something harmless, something that the child in the backseat might have drawn.<br><br>Ann runs her hand over the dashboard and the soft, moist pollen of last summer sticks to her palm. It is all put together for her, here. The rearview mirror is up again, glued in place, and there&#x2019;s a dream catcher thrown around it, with two fluorescent feathers hanging down. The carpet has been shampooed, the right backseat replaced entirely, with one that looks like the original on the left, only a brighter shade of blue and missing the little holes where the stuffing came out and where the girls might have once stuck their fingers.<br><br>Ann turns the key to let the engine run while she sits here. She breathes deeply. Nine years and the smell of the mouse&#x2019;s nest is gone, but every now and then, when she shifts in the driver&#x2019;s seat and the dust rises from the cushions, she catches what might be the hint of that old smell, distant and thinly sweet, leather and burning grass.<br><br>Though of course it could also be the controlled spring fires down in the valley fields, far away.<br><br>&#x25a0;<br><br>Ann and Wade have been married for eight years. She is thirty-�eight now, and Wade is fifty.<br><br>Last year, Ann found a box of Wade&#x2019;s old shirts in the attic. She brought the box downstairs and sat on her knees in a warm square of sunlight on the floor. She unfolded the shirts one at a time, held each one up, and placed some in a pile for the Salvation Army and some in a pile to keep.<br><br>Wade walked into the bedroom and saw her doing this.<br><br>&#x201c;Is this too small?&#x201d; she said. She didn&#x2019;t turn around because she was trying to decide about an oil stain. She was holding the shirt up above her, to see the light shine through it.<br><br>Wade didn&#x2019;t answer. She thought he hadn&#x2019;t heard. She folded the shirt and moved on.<br><br>But the next thing she knew, Wade was pushing her head down, pushing it hard, into the box of clothes. She was so shocked that at first she laughed. But he didn&#x2019;t stop. The cardboard edge rubbed against her throat, and her laugh became a gasp for air and then a scream. She clawed at his legs, thrashing blindly. She pounded her fists on his shoes, jammed her elbows into his knees. He was speaking to her in a voice she recognized&#x2014;�she couldn&#x2019;t think from where&#x2014;�but it was not a voice he&#x2019;d ever used with her. &#x201c;No! No!&#x201d;&#x2014;�almost a growl.<br><br>His dogs. He used that voice to train the dogs.<br><br>Then he let her go. He stepped back. She lifted her head, slowly, with caution. He sighed deeply, then he touched her shoulder as if to ask for her forgiveness, or&#x2014;�this occurred to her even in her shock&#x2014;�to offer forgiveness to her. After a minute, he asked her if she&#x2019;d seen his mowing shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, staring into the box of clothes. She sat on her knees, shaking, smoothing down the static in her hair, over and over again, as if that would make a difference. Wade found his shoes, put them on, went outside. In a few minutes, she heard the tractor. Wade was clearing the knapweed from the pasture.<br><br>In the year leading up to the strange episode with the box of clothes, he had done other things that alarmed her. He made phone calls to his customers, accusing them of sending bad checks, even as Ann proved to him with bank statements that he was wrong. He threaded his bootlaces so that they tied at the bottom instead of the top. He purchased the same pair of pliers three times in one week. He threw her fresh loaf of bread, still sinking in its warmth, into the mulch bucket to feed the hens as if she had baked it for them. Once, in the last week of January, he cut a beautiful white pine and dragged it a mile through the new snow. When he arrived in the yard where Ann was, he motioned to it, smiling. &#x201c;You think this is too tall?&#x201d;<br><br>A Christmas tree.<br><br>&#x201c;But Christmas&#x2014;� Wade, it was a month ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t remember?&#x201d; She laughed, horrified. &#x201c;Where do you think you got that coat you&#x2019;re wearing?&#x201d;<br><br>But the day he pushed her into the box of clothes was something very different; it was the only time his disease manifested itself in violence, violence so far removed from the man he was that Ann couldn&#x2019;t fathom such a thing happening even in the moments that immediately followed.<br><br>But after it happened once, it happened again. A few months later, he pushed her against the refrigerator, so that her cheek pressed against a coupon she&#x2019;d hung there, for a diner called Panhandler Pies. She fought him, but just like the first time, fighting only hurt her more. When he let her go, she pushed him away from her and screamed at him, but he just stood there sadly, as if disappointed in her.<br><br>Another day, not too long after that, Ann poured a bucket of pinecones onto the kitchen table. She intended to decorate them with peanut butter and birdseed, to hang on the tree limbs for the finches. But as soon as she sat down to work, she felt his hand on her head, and he pushed her down into the pinecones.<br><br>The pinecones left a rash of tiny cuts on her left cheek.<br><br>Later still, the wind blew open the door of one of his daughters&#x2019; old rooms. He thought it was Ann who had opened it. He pressed her forehead against the door once it was closed again, and told her, &#x201c;No, no, no,&#x201d; until she said, in her fear and shock, &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>She did not understand these things, but knew that Wade didn&#x2019;t understand them, either, and so she found no way to express her anger. No way to stop these episodes from happening again. The pain and the shock of them wore off the more they happened, and she began to bear the assaults because she didn&#x2019;t know what else she could do. She took note of what provoked him, and made sure never to do those things again. No more pinecones, no Panhandler Pies, no boxes of old clothes, no going in his daughters&#x2019; rooms. Simple enough. These things were a kind of collection she began to keep, a list she would run down in her mind, eventually not out of pain anymore but out of wonder, as if something were right there on the edge of her life, waiting for her to discover it. At night, when he was asleep, she thought about these things as she studied the face she loved. His pale eyelids stark on his sun-�roughed face. His lips chapped, his cheeks unshaven. Such inherent kindness in his body that it was impossible to picture this man doing the things he had certainly done. She touched her lips to his thick hair, and she closed her eyes, too.</p><h2>Elastic Habits: How to Create Smarter Habits That Adapt to Your Day</h2><p><p><strong>From the author of&nbsp;<em>Mini Habits</em>, the international bestselling book&nbsp;in 18 languages,&nbsp;comes a smarter approach to habit-building.</strong></p><p>If an elephant charges at you, what do you do?&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Scream, yell, and wave your hands.</li><li>Dive between its legs.</li><li>Run away while calling the elephant names, like &#x201c;dork.&#x201d;</li></ol><p>According to National Geographic, standing your ground and making noise gives you the best chance of surviving an elephant charge.

Yes, and it&#x2019;s called an elastic habit.</p><p><b><strong>What Is an Elastic Habit?</strong></b></p><p>Elastic habits are daily behaviors with multiple win conditions. You get to choose your&nbsp;win condition every day, because some days you feel like you&#x2019;re being attacked by a bear and other days&nbsp;<em>you feel like the bear</em>.</p><p>Most people associate &#x201c;elastic&#x201d; with yoga pants and rubber bands. But the word also means &#x201c;resilient&#x201d;&#x2014;the ability to withstand pressure.</p><p>A traditional habit is rigid: the same behavior is done at the same time to the same level every day. Unless it's small (like a mini habit),&nbsp;the pressures of modern life tend to break its rigid and brittle shell. Elastic habits are fluid: they can change their form and intensity to suit each unique day. They survive busy, tired, bad days. They thrive on better days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elastic habit example (fitness):</strong>&nbsp;On Monday, you're tired and busy, so you do 5 push-ups to meet the easy level. Success. The next day, you have more time, energy, and motivation, so you go to the gym for a 45-minute workout. Big success! The next day, you do a workout video for 20 minutes for a medium-sized win. Success. With what I call &#x201c;3x3&nbsp;flexibility,&#x201d; elastic habits give you nine win conditions instead of one;&nbsp;you can win every day and form life-changing habits.</p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s fatigue, a busy day, or something else charging at you, your elastic habit can adapt to the exact threat it faces. And if the wind is at your back, watch out world, because your elastic habit can also expand for an inspiring big win! That's what makes an elastic habit smarter (and more fun) than the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>Read&nbsp;<em>Elastic Habits</em>&nbsp;now, and&nbsp;give your habits the elasticity to&nbsp;survive and thrive in all circumstances.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Woman After God&#39;s Own Heart--A Devotional</h2><p><p>Make daily progress toward becoming a woman after God's own heart with these helpful and encouraging devotions from bestselling author Elizabeth George.

Much to her annoyance, she is accompanied by a thirty-six-year-old chaperone, who is neither mother nor friend. Cora Carlisle, a complicated but traditional woman with her own reasons for making the trip, has no idea what she&#x2019;s in for. Young Louise, already stunningly beautiful and sporting her famous black bob with blunt bangs, is known for her arrogance and her lack of respect for convention. Ultimately, the five weeks they spend together will transform their lives forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Cora, the city holds the promise of discovery that might answer the question at the core of her being, and even as she does her best to watch over Louise in this strange and bustling place she embarks on a mission of her own. And while what she finds isn&#x2019;t what she anticipated, she is liberated in a way she could not have imagined.

She lives in Kansas.<p>ONE</p><p><i>The first time Cora heard the name Louise Brooks,</i> she was parked outside the Wichita Library in a Model-T Ford, waiting for the rain to stop. If Cora had been alone, unencumbered, she might have made a dash across the lawn and up the library&#x2019;s stone steps, but she and her friend Viola Hammond had spent the morning going door-to-door in their neighborhood, collecting books for the new children&#x2019;s room, and the considerable fruits of their efforts were safe and dry in four crates in the backseat. The storm, they decided, would be a short one, and they couldn&#x2019;t risk the books getting wet.</p><p>And really, Cora thought, staring out into the rain, it wasn&#x2019;t as if she had anything else to do. Her boys were already gone for the summer, both of them working on a farm outside Winfield. In the fall, they would leave for college. Cora was still getting used to the quiet, and also the freedom, of this new era of her life. Now, long after Della left for the day, the house stayed clean, with no muddy footprints on the floor, and no records scattered around the phonograph. There were no squabbles over the car to mediate, no tennis matches at the club to cheer on, and no assigned essays to proofread and commend. The pantry and icebox actually stayed stocked with food without daily trips to the store. Today, with Alan at work, she had no reason to rush home at all.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we took your car and not ours,&#x201d; Viola said, adjusting her hat, which was pretty, a puffed turban with an ostrich feather curling down from the crown. &#x201c;People say closed cars are a luxury, but not on a day like this.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora gave her what she hoped was a modest smile. Not only was the car covered, it had come with an electric starter. <i>Cranking cars, no business for a lady,</i> was how the ad went, though Alan had admitted he didn&#x2019;t miss cranking, either.</p><p>Viola turned, eyeing the books in the backseat. &#x201c;People were generous,&#x201d; she allowed. Viola was a decade older than Cora, her hair already gray at the temples, and she spoke with the authority of her added years. &#x201c;Mostly. You notice Myra Brooks didn&#x2019;t even open her door.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora hadn&#x2019;t noticed. She&#x2019;d been working the other side of the street. &#x201c;Maybe she wasn&#x2019;t home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the piano.&#x201d; Viola&#x2019;s eyes slid toward Cora. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t bother to stop playing when I knocked. I have to say, she&#x2019;s very good.&#x201d;</p><p>Lightning shot across the western sky, and though both women flinched, Cora, without thinking, smiled. She&#x2019;d always loved these late-spring storms. They came on so fast, rolling in from the prairie on expanding columns of clouds, a welcome release from the day&#x2019;s building heat. An hour before, when Cora and Viola were canvassing, the sun was hot in a blue sky. Now rain fell fast enough to slice green leaves from the big oak outside the library. The lilacs trembled and tossed.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think she&#x2019;s a tiresome snob?&#x201d;</p><p>Cora hesitated. She didn&#x2019;t like to gossip, but she could hardly count Myra Brooks as a friend. And they&#x2019;d been to how many suffrage meetings together? Had marched together in the street? Yet if she passed Myra today on Douglas Avenue, Cora wouldn&#x2019;t get so much as a hello. Still, she never got the feeling that it was snobbery as much as Myra simply not registering her existence, and there was a chance it was nothing personal. Myra Brooks didn&#x2019;t seem to look at anyone, Cora had noticed, not unless she was the one speaking, watching for the impression she made. And yet, of course, everyone looked at her. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful woman Cora had ever seen in person: she had pale skin, flawless, and large, dark eyes, and then all that thick, dark hair. She was certainly a talented speaker&#x2014;her voice was never shrill, and her enunciations were clear. But everyone knew it was Myra&#x2019;s looks that had made her a particularly good spokeswoman for the Movement, a nice antidote to the newspapers&#x2019; idea of what a suffragist looked like. And you could tell she was intelligent, cultured. She was supposed to know everything about music, the works of all the famous composers. She certainly knew how to charm. Once, when she was at the podium, she had looked down at Cora, right into her eyes, and smiled as if they were friends.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really know her,&#x201d; Cora said. She looked back out through the blurred windshield, at people ducking out from a streetcar, running for cover. Alan had taken a streetcar to work, so she could have the Ford.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll inform you. Myra Brooks is a tiresome snob.&#x201d; Viola turned to Cora with a little smile, the ostrich plume grazing her chin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you the latest example: she just sent a note to the secretary of our club. Apparently, Madame Brooks is looking for someone to accompany one of her daughters to New York this summer. The older one, Louise, got into some prestigious dance school there, but she&#x2019;s only fifteen. Myra actually wants one of <i>us</i> to go with her. For over a month!&#x201d; Viola seemed pleasantly outraged, her cheeks rosy, her eyes bright. &#x201c;I mean, really! I don&#x2019;t know what she&#x2019;s thinking. That we&#x2019;re the help? That one of us will be her Irish nanny?&#x201d; She frowned and shook her head. &#x201c;Most of us have progressive husbands, but I can&#x2019;t imagine any one of them would spare a wife for over a month so she could go to New York City, of all places. Myra herself is too busy to go. She has to lie around the house and play the piano.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora pursed her lips. <i>New York.</i> She felt the old ache right away. &#x201c;Well. I suppose she has other children to look after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, she does, but that&#x2019;s not it. She doesn&#x2019;t take care of them. They&#x2019;re motherless, those children. Poor Louise goes to Sunday school by herself. The instructor is Edward Vincent, and he picks her up and takes her home every Sunday. I heard that right from his wife. Myra and Leonard are alleged Presbyterians, but you never see them at church, do you? They&#x2019;re too sophisticated, you see. They don&#x2019;t make the other children go, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That speaks well of the daughter, that she makes the effort to go on her own.&#x201d; Cora cocked her head. &#x201c;I wonder if I&#x2019;ve ever seen her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Louise? Oh, you would remember. She doesn&#x2019;t look like anyone else. Her hair is black like Myra&#x2019;s, but perfectly straight like an Oriental&#x2019;s, and she wears it in a Buster Brown.&#x201d; Viola gestured just below her ears. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t bob it. She had it cut like that when they moved here years ago. It&#x2019;s too short and severe, a horrible look, in my opinion, not feminine at all. But even so, I have to say, she&#x2019;s a very pretty girl. Prettier than her mother.&#x201d; She smiled, leaning back in her seat. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s some justice in that, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora tried to picture this black-haired girl, more beautiful than her beautiful mother. Her gloved hand moved to the back of her own hair, which was dark, but not remarkably so. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t perfectly straight, though it looked presentable, she hoped, pinned up under her straw hat. Cora had been told she had a kind, pleasant face, and that she was lucky to have good teeth. But that had never added up to striking beauty. And now she was thirty-six.</p><p>&#x201c;My own girls are threatening to cut their hair,&#x201d; Viola said with a sigh. &#x201c;Foolish. This bobbing business is just a craze. When it&#x2019;s over, everyone who followed the lemmings over the cliff will need years to grow their hair out. A lot of people won&#x2019;t hire girls with bobbed hair. I try to warn them, but they won&#x2019;t listen. They just laugh at me. And they have their own language, their own secret code for them and their friends. Do you know what Ethel called me the other day? She called me a <i>wurp</i>. That&#x2019;s not a real word. But when I tell them that, they laugh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just trying to rattle you,&#x201d; Cora said with a smile. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sure they won&#x2019;t really bob their hair.&#x201d; Really, it seemed unlikely. The magazines were full of short-haired girls, but in Wichita, bobs were still a rarity. &#x201c;I do think it looks good on some girls,&#x201d; Cora said shyly. &#x201c;Short hair, I mean. And it must feel cooler, and lighter. Just think&#x2014;you could throw all your hairpins away.&#x201d;</p><p>Viola looked at her, eyebrows raised.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; Cora again touched the back of her neck. &#x201c;I might if I were younger.&#x201d;</p><p>The rain was coming down faster, rapping hard on the roof of the car.</p><p>Viola crossed her arms. &#x201c;Well, if my girls do cut their hair, I can tell you now, it won&#x2019;t be so they can throw away hairpins. They&#x2019;ll do it to be provocative. To <i>look</i> provocative. That&#x2019;s what passes for fashion these days. That&#x2019;s what young people are all about now.&#x201d; She sounded suddenly stricken, more confused than indignant. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it, Cora. I raised them to have propriety. But both of them are suddenly obsessed with showing the world their knees. They roll their skirts up after they leave the house. I can tell by the waistbands. I know they defy me. They roll their stockings down, too.&#x201d; She gazed out into the rain, lines branching beneath her eyes. &#x201c;What I don&#x2019;t know is why, what&#x2019;s going on in their little heads, why they don&#x2019;t care about the message they&#x2019;re sending. When I was young, I never felt the need to show the general public my knees.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Those two cause me more grief than all four of my boys. I envy you, Cora. You&#x2019;re lucky to only have sons.&#x201d;</p><p>Maybe, Cora thought. She did love the very maleness of the twins, their robust health and confidence, their practical taste in clothing, their easy reconciliations after heated quarrels. Earle was smaller and quieter than Howard, but even he seemed capable of forgetting all worries when he held a racquet or a bat. She loved that they had both wanted to work on a farm, seeing it as an adventure in country living and physical labor, though she also worried they had no idea how much labor they&#x2019;d signed on for. And she knew she <i>had</i> been lucky with her sons, and not just in the way that Viola meant. The Hendersons next door had a son just four years older than the twins, but those few years had made all the difference&#x2014;Stuart Henderson had been killed in early 1918, fighting in France. Four years later, Cora was still stunned. For her, Stuart Henderson would always be a gangly adolescent, smiling and waving from his bike at her own boys, who were small then, still in short pants. Really, being lucky with sons seemed a matter of timing.</p><p>But whatever Viola said, Cora thought she might have fared just as well with daughters. She would have been good with girls, perhaps, using the right combination of instruction and understanding. Maybe Viola was just going about it the wrong way.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Cora. Something is wrong with this new generation. They don&#x2019;t care about anything important. When we were young, we wanted the vote. We wanted social reform. Girls today just want to... walk around practically naked so they can be stared at. It&#x2019;s as if they have no other calling.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora could hardly disagree. It really was shocking, how much skin girls were showing these days. And she wasn&#x2019;t some old prude or Mrs. Grundy; she was fairly sure she wasn&#x2019;t a <i>wurp</i>, though she didn&#x2019;t know what that meant, either. Cora had been pleased when the hemlines moved up to nine inches from the ankle. Some leg showed, true, but that change seemed sensible: no more skirts trailing in the mud and bringing typhoid or who knows what into the house. And calf length was far preferable to the ridiculous hobble skirts that she herself had stumbled around in, all for the sake of fashion, not so long ago. Still, girls were now sporting skirts so short that their knees showed every time the wind blew, and there was no practical reason for that. Viola was right: a girl who wore a skirt that short just wanted to be looked at, and looked at <i>in that way</i>. Cora had even seen a few women her own age showing their knees, right here in Wichita, and really, in her opinion, these half-naked matrons looked especially vulgar.</p><p>Viola looked at her brightly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the reasons I&#x2019;m joining the Klan.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora turned. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Klan. Ku Klux. They sent a representative to the club last week. I wish you would have been there, Cora. They&#x2019;re very interested in women joining up, holding positions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they are,&#x201d; Cora murmured. &#x201c;We vote.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a cynic. They were much more specific than that. They know that there are serious women&#x2019;s issues at hand, and that women need to be in the fight.&#x201d; The ostrich feather bobbed as she spoke. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re against all this modernization, all these outside influences on our youth. They&#x2019;re interested in racial purity, of course, but they&#x2019;re just as interested in teaching personal purity for young women. We do need to keep our race pure, and Good Lord, we need to keep it going. My brother-in-law says a veritable takeover is coming, and it&#x2019;s all being planned in the basement of the Vatican. That&#x2019;s the real reason Catholics have so many children, you know, and meanwhile, our people have one or two or none at...&#x201d;</p><p>Viola trailed off. She rolled her lips in. It took Cora a moment to understand.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Viola said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean you. Your situation is different.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora waved her off. The twins were what she had. But both she and Viola were silent for a while, and there was only the tapping rain.</p><p>&#x201c;In any case,&#x201d; Viola said finally, &#x201c;I think it would be good for the girls. Good, moral people to mix with.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora swallowed, feeling short of breath. She had been wearing a corset day in, day out, for so many years that she rarely registered it as a discomfort. It seemed a part of her body. But in moments of distress, such as now, she was aware of her constricted rib cage. She would have to choose her words carefully. She could not come across as personally concerned.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said, her voice breezy, not betraying her in any way. &#x201c;Oh, Viola. The Klan? They wear those white gowns, those hoods with the spooky eyeholes.&#x201d; She fluttered her gloved hands. &#x201c;And they have wizards and grand wizards, and bonfires.&#x201d; Even as she smiled, she glanced into Viola&#x2019;s small blue eyes, analyzing what she saw there. She had to consider her options, her best route to success. Viola was older, but Cora was richer. She would capitalize on that.</p><p>&#x201c;It just seems a little... common.&#x201d; She shrugged, apologetic.</p><p>Viola cocked her head. &#x201c;But lots of people are&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Cora smiled again. She had chosen the right word, precisely. It was as if they were shopping at the Innes Department Store together, and Cora had shown disdain for an ugly china pattern. She already knew, with certainty, Viola would reconsider.</p><p>When the rain let up, they slid out and carried the crates in, sidestepping puddles, each woman making two trips. Inside, waiting for the librarian, they chatted about other things. They flipped through a pristine copy of <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, and smiled at the illustrations. They stopped at the Lassen Hotel for tea, and then Cora drove Viola home.</p><p><i>So many years later,</i> this easy ride home with Viola would be the part of the story where Cora, in the telling, would momentarily lose the regard of a grandniece she adored. This grandniece, who at seventeen, incidentally, wore her hair much longer than her mother preferred, would be frustrated to the point of tears that in 1961 she was not yet ol...</p></p><h2>The Twelve Apostles: Michael Collins, the Squad, and Ireland&#39;s Fight for Freedom</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The unofficial voice of modern Irish history.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Economist</i></b><br><br><b>"Ireland's best-known historical writer."&#x2014;<i>The Irish Times</i></b><br><br><b>"A worthy contribution to the historical literature of the period."&#x2014;<i>Irish Central</i></b><br><br>Ireland, 1919: When Sinn F�in proclaims D�il �ireann the parliament of the independent Irish republic, London declares the new assembly to be illegal, and a vicious guerrilla war breaks out between republican and crown forces.

She turned to ten-year-old Zeus, who was walking next to her. &#x201c;Okay, Boltbrain, what&#x2019;s the plan?&#x201d;<br> <br>The black-haired boy frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;d better start thinking faster, because we&#x2019;re on our way to face an army of Cronies, a family of Titans, and a father who wants to swallow us whole,&#x201d; Hera reminded him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know that,&#x201d; Zeus said. &#x201c;Just give me a minute!&#x201d;<br> <br>Not long ago Zeus had learned that he wasn&#x2019;t a normal boy. Pythia, an oracle at Delphi, had told him that he was an Olympian, a god, a hero in training. And he was destined to overthrow the mighty King Cronus and the Titans, who ruled Greece with cruelty and fear.<br> <br>Pythia had also told Zeus that he couldn&#x2019;t do it alone. So for the last few months he had been on an epic journey to find the other Olympians&#x2014;other immortal kids who were ten years old, just like him. Together they had battled monsters. They&#x2019;d taken on the Cronies, King Cronus&#x2019;s army of half-giants. And they&#x2019;d faced many Titans&#x2014;giant gods with incredible powers.<br> <br>Now all the Olympians were finally together, fourteen of them in all&#x2014;plus four men with goat horns and hairy goat legs, who&#x2019;d come with the newest Olympian, Dionysus. The Olympians even had help from a friend named Ron and his flying horse, Pegasus. But Hera was right. The battle ahead of them was a big one&#x2014;an impossible one, even&#x2014;and they needed a plan.<br> <br>Zeus looked up and saw a white horse with wings flying toward them. He stopped, and the other Olympians stopped too.<br> <br>The horse landed, and a boy with curly blond hair jumped off the horse&#x2019;s back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you see anything, Ron?&#x201d; Zeus asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are pockets of Cronies between here and Mount Olympus,&#x201d; Ron reported. &#x201c;It will be hard to avoid them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought,&#x201d; he said. He turned to the others. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re right on the coast. We should take a boat. It&#x2019;ll be safer&#x2014;and faster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, why exactly would we want to get to Mount Olympus faster?&#x201d; asked Poseidon, one of Zeus&#x2019;s brothers. &#x201c;The Titans are there, waiting to smash us to smithereens. Not to mention that Ron heard there was an enormous dragon at Mount Titan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And how exactly is taking a boat safer?&#x201d; asked Hera. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t Oceanus be waiting for us if we take a boat?&#x201d;<br> <br>Oceanus was one of the Titans&#x2014;a big golden-skinned giant who could harness the powers of the sea.<br> <br>Ares stepped forward. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve beaten Oceanus before! We can beat him again!&#x201d; he said, shaking his fist. His red eyes were blazing.<br> <br>Hephaestus snorted. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t stop Oceanus last time. He got scared off when King Cronus started fighting with his dad, Uranus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can still beat him!&#x201d; Ares argued.<br> <br>Athena, a serious-looking girl with gray eyes, spoke up. &#x201c;Zeus, do we even need a boat?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Apollo can make anything he sings about come true when he plays his golden lyre. Couldn&#x2019;t he just sing a song about us appearing at Mount Olympus?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus nodded. &#x201c;I thought about that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I think it&#x2019;s too risky. Apollo is just getting used to his new magical object. And if he sings the song a little bit wrong, somebody could get hurt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Athena asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if he sings about us appearing in Olympus, we might end up trapped inside the mountain,&#x201d; Zeus replied. &#x201c;Or right on King Cronus&#x2019;s lap!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate to admit it, but Thunderpants has a point,&#x201d; Hera agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too risky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And facing Oceanus isn&#x2019;t risky?&#x201d; Hephaestus asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a vote,&#x201d; suggested Hestia, one of Zeus&#x2019;s sisters.<br> <br>Zeus was about to agree, but he stopped himself. He was a leader, and as a leader he had to do what was best for everybody. A vote might only lead to arguing.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re taking a boat,&#x201d; Zeus said firmly. He looked the other Olympians in the eyes. Nobody questioned him.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a village just up ahead,&#x201d; Ron said. &#x201c;We can get a boat there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hermes flew down from the sky, powered by his magical winged sandals. &#x201c;I was just going to say that!&#x201d; he said. Zeus had sent the flying Olympian to scout along with Ron. &#x201c;It should be easy for us to find a boat to buy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, then,&#x201d; Zeus said. He started walking, and the others fell in step behind him.<br> <br>Ron walked next to him, leading Pegasus.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, why does Hera call you &#x2018;Thunderboy&#x2019; and &#x2018;Boltbrain&#x2019; and &#x2018;Bolt Breath&#x2019; and stuff like that?&#x201d; he asked Zeus.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because of Bolt,&#x201d; Zeus replied, patting the lightning bolt&#x2013;shaped dagger tucked into his belt. He had pulled Bolt from a cone-shaped stone at Delphi. Even though many people had tried before him, Zeus had been the only one to pull Bolt free. Bolt was usually dagger-size, but it could grow up to five feet long&#x2014;which was very useful!<br> <br>Ron nodded. &#x201c;I thought so, but she says those names like having Bolt is a bad thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus nodded. &#x201c;And when she started doing it, she meant it that way. I think she was jealous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jealous?&#x201d; Ron asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, every Olympian has at least one magical object,&#x201d; Zeus replied. &#x201c;I got Bolt and Chip right away.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked down at Chip, the round, smooth stone pendant he wore around his neck. Chip was Zeus&#x2019;s other magical object, and it helped guide the Olympians in the right direction. The stone also spoke Chip Latin, which was like Pig Latin.<br> <br>&#x201c;But it took Hera a long time to get her magical peacock feather,&#x201d; Zeus continued. &#x201c;And I think having to wait so long really bugged her. Now I think she just calls me names because she&#x2019;s used to doing it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, that makes sense,&#x201d; Ron said. He looked over at Pegasus. &#x201c;I guess Pegasus is my magical object. Well, not an object, really. But you know. And I&#x2019;m not even an Olympian!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but we&#x2019;re glad you&#x2019;re with us,&#x201d; Zeus said. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re going to need all the help we can get.&#x201d;<br> <br>They had reached the village. Scattered small huts overlooked a sandy shoreline. Several boats bobbed in the turquoise sea, tied to a wooden dock.<br> <br>Demeter, the third of Zeus&#x2019;s sisters, nodded to Zeus. &#x201c;Aphrodite and I will try to get a boat,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Aphrodite grinned and tossed her magical golden apple from one hand to the other. Gold coins showered down from the apple and landed at her feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think this will be enough?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>Demeter grinned. &#x201c;Plenty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Minutes later the group was ready to sail away on a boat that fit all nineteen of them, and the horse as well. Aphrodite&#x2019;s bubbly charm and endless supply of gold had also helped buy a barrel of fresh water, six loaves of bread, two small wheels of cheese, and a parcel of salted fish.<br> <br>Zeus watched as the Olympians boarded the boat. Hera, Hestia, and Demeter&#x2014;his three sisters&#x2014;stuck together like they always did. So did his brothers&#x2014;Poseidon, god of the sea; and Hades, lord of the Underworld. The two boys were rolling the barrel of water up the ramp.<br> <br>Then came the twins, Apollo and Artemis. Apollo&#x2019;s sister was as talented with a bow and arrow as Apollo was with his lyre.<br> <br>Hermes flew over their heads. He was one of the newest Olympians, but Zeus suspected that with his magic staff he might be one of the most powerful.<br> <br>Dionysus walked behind Apollo and Artemis. He looked more nervous than any of the rest, even though he was flanked by the four guys with goat horns&#x2014;the members of his band.<br> <br>I would be nervous too if I were him, Zeus thought. Just last night he was the lead singer in a band. And now he&#x2019;s headed to meet the scary Titans!<br> <br>Athena and Aphrodite followed Dionysus, whispering to each other. When Aphrodite had first washed ashore in her shell, Athena had been a little wary of the newest addition to the group. But the two girls were now close.<br> <br>And last came Ares and Hephaestus. Hephaestus leaned on his magnificent silver cane with the skull on top, glaring at the back of Ares&#x2019;s head as they walked on board.<br> <br>Those two have never gotten along, Zeus thought. But they&#x2019;ll have to start getting along very soon, or we&#x2019;ll never defeat King Cronus.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we ready to set sail?&#x201d; Zeus asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, captain!&#x201d; Poseidon called out, hoisting the sails. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a good breeze today. Mount Titan, here we come!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ares, Hades, Artemis, and Hera each took an oar and steered the boat out of the port. Soon they were zipping up the coast, propelled by a light wind.<br> <br>Zeus started to relax. The salt air gave him energy, and a yellow sun shone in the blue sky overhead. He walked over to Hera.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s work on that plan now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly the sailboat lurched. The calm waves around them began to churn.<br> <br>With a mighty roar an enormous head rose from the waves: a head with long hair, a long beard, and angry eyes underneath green bushy eyebrows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Flipping fish sticks! It&#x2019;s Oceanus!&#x201d; Poseidon cried.<br> <br>Hera yelled, &#x201c;Ha! I told you so!&#x201d;</p><h2>Life Among the Savages</h2><p><b>In a hilariously charming domestic memoir, America&#x2019;s celebrated master of terror turns to a different kind of fright: raising children</b><br><br> In her celebrated fiction, Shirley Jackson explored the darkness lurking beneath the surface of small-town America. But in <i>Life Among the Savages</i>, she takes on the lighter side of small-town life. In this witty and warm memoir of her family&#x2019;s life in rural Vermont, she delightfully exposes a domestic side in cheerful contrast to her quietly terrifying fiction. With a novelist&#x2019;s gift for character, an unfailing maternal instinct, and her signature humor, Jackson turns everyday family experiences into brilliant adventures.</p><p>Can this be the author of such chilling tales as <i>The Lottery</i> and <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>? An ordinary housewife stuck in a big, shabby house with three marvelous, demanding children and a charming husband who takes detached interest in the chaos they generate? Yes, it's Shirley Jackson all right: the precision of her observations and prose is familiar, even if her humor is something of a surprise. Not until Anne Lamott's <i>Operating Instructions</i> in 1993 would another woman write with such honesty about the maddening multitude of trivial, essential chores that constitute a mother's life. But Jackson nailed it first, 40 years earlier, in her hilarious chronicle of life in a small Vermont town, where getting the kids to school on time requires the combined gifts of a drill sergeant and a lady's maid. The saga of her son's bumpy adjustment to kindergarten, frequently anthologized as <i>Charles</i>, is justly famous, but Jackson's account of the Department Store Trip from Hell (two kids, two toy guns, one doll carriage and doll, mayhem in revolving doors and escalators) is even funnier. Although her memoirs are as merciless as her ghost stories, you may not notice because you're laughing so hard. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Shirley Jackson (1919&#x2013;1965), a celebrated writer of horror, wrote many stories as well as six novels and two works of nonfiction.</p><h2>How to Influence People: Make a Difference in Your World</h2><p>Leadership guru John C.

It is this approach to learning that has led us to create "How Patterns Work", so that those who wish to learn pattern making can have a simplified and streamlined introduction to all of the fundamental principles that lie at the core of pattern making.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you have tried to learn pattern making in the past and felt daunted by the complex drawings and measurements, or are a sewer who has felt ill equipped to make even the simplest changes to patterns, then this is the ideal book for you. We believe that by having a solid understanding of the basic terms and processes of pattern making then you will be able to make simple pattern changes yourself, and be able to apply the same ideas to more complex pattern changes in the future. No previous knowledge of pattern making is required. Chapters start from zero assumed knowledge and build slowly in complexity with step-by-step examples and clear diagrams. <br> &nbsp;<br> Please note that this book does not include paper patterns and does not cover specific pattern or block drafting exercises from measurements. Instead, this book will provide you with an overview to simplify the way you think about pattern making, arming you with knowledge that can be applied to any pattern change.<br> &nbsp;<br> As an introductory book, "How Patterns Work" has been designed to work as a companion alongside more complex pattern drafting books. In a way, the first half of the book is almost like a long form dictionary of pattern terms to help provide a thorough explanation of all the different features of patterns such as grain lines, seam allowances, darts and notches. All of the examples are discussed in relation to how the pattern will ultimately be sewn, so that the principles become more relevant to real sewn garments.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first section of the book will answer questions such as:<br> <ul><li>What are darts and how do they work with the curves of the body?</li><li>What is seam allowance and how much should you add to your pattern?</li><li>How are body measurements used to create accurate patterns?</li><li>What are blocks or slopers and how are they different to patterns?</li><li>What do the basic blocks look like?</li></ul><br> The second half of the book shows a range of pattern making changes that can be learnt separately and can then be applied in different combinations to any garment patterns to suit your own pattern making needs. The reason why these pattern changes have been shown away from specific garments is to enable you to focus on the logic behind the pattern change, instead of becoming confused by the actual shape of the garment, or being distracted by working out body measurements.<br> &nbsp;<br> All of the examples listed below are shown using both the cut and spread, and the pivot flat pattern making methods, and then also shown as a draped section of fabric on a mannequin, allowing you to really see the pattern changes as both a flat pattern, and in a more tangible 3D form. The examples that are covered in this section include:<br> <ul><li>Adding and removing a seam line.</li><li>Moving the position of a dart.</li><li>Turning darts into seam lines and vice versa.</li><li>Increasing and decreasing volume evenly.</li><li>Increasing and decreasing volume around a point.</li><li>Using darts to increase volume.</li></ul><br> While the book can often appear very simple, our approach has been that when you are really stuck on a part of the pattern making process and you feel like you are not quite "getting it", then a longer explanation with detailed diagrams can help the idea to really click, making it easier for you to apply the same pattern change in future.<br> &nbsp;<br> "How Patterns Work" has been designed with:<br> <ul><li>Over 70,000 words of text content.</li><li>Over 250 diagrams in crisp black, white and grey.</li><li>A clear table of contents for easy reference.</li></ul></p><p>Assembil is a fashion innovation company.<br><br>We believe that the fashion industry needs a rethink, and that every step in the creation of fashion has the potential to be re-imagined using new techniques and new technology. Future Assembil projects will examine the way that fashion is taught, designed, manufactured, distributed, consumed and appreciated, and offer alternative solutions to traditional models.&nbsp;Unlike other creative industries, fashion has been slow to embrace the nimble nature of digital products and services. We believe that one of the ways that technology can be better utilised in the fashion industry is in the way that people learn about the design and construction of fashion.<br><br>We believe in the power of great design, but professional quality design has traditionally been expensive or out of reach for most people. We want to change this. We're passionate about helping people of all abilities to design and make their own high quality fashion by giving them access to the necessary skills and knowledge to create beautifully crafted clothing.&nbsp;For this reason, our first project begins in the world of fashion education, with our first product being a streamlined pattern making book developed specifically for digital devices. We hope that you enjoy reading "How Patterns Work"."The illustrations are clearly developed, and together with the descriptions in plain language, make links evident between various parts of the flat patternmaking process in a way that is easy to follow. I recommend this text alongside other flat patternmaking texts to enable various modes of learning in our first year flat patternmaking subjects. It is great to also be able to recommend the e-book version, and this has been received well by the students."<br><br> <i>- Donna Sgro, Fashion Lecturer</i></p><h2>The Meaning of Life</h2><p>To wonder too openly or intensely about the meaning of life can seem a peculiar, ill-fated and faintly ridiculous pastime. It can seem like a topic on which ordinary mortals cannot make much progress. In truth, it is for all of us to wonder about, define and work towards a more meaningful existence.<br>This book presents a range of areas in which we might seek the meaning of life, including love, family, friendship, work, self-knowledge and nature. We learn why certain things feel meaningful while others don&#x2019;t, and consider how we might introduce more meaning into our activities.</p><p><p><strong>The School of Life</strong> is a global organization helping people lead more fulfilled lives.

Led by founder and series editor <strong>Alain de Botton</strong>, this is a library to educate, entertain, console, and transform us. </p><strong>Care</strong><br><br><p>One way to get a sense of why love should so often be considered close to the meaning of life is to look at the challenges of loneliness. Frequently, we leave the topic of loneliness unmentioned: those without anyone to hold feel shame; those with someone might feel (a background degree of) guilt. But the pains of loneliness are an unembarrassing and universal possibility. We shouldn&#x2019;t feel lonely about being lonely. Unwittingly, loneliness gives us the most eloquent insights into why love matters so much. There are few greater experts on the importance of love than those who are bereft of anyone to love. It is hard to know quite what all the fuss around love might be about until and unless one has, somewhere along the way, spent some bitter, unwanted passages in one&#x2019;s own company. When we are alone, people may try to show us kindness; there may be invitations and touching gestures, but it will be hard to escape the lingering sense of the conditionality of the interest and care on offer. We are liable to sense the limits of the availability of even the best-disposed companions and sense the restrictions of the demands we can make upon them. It is often too late, or too early, to call. In bleak moments, we may suspect we could disappear off the earth and no one would notice or care. In ordinary company, we cannot simply share whatever is passing through our minds: too much of our inner monologue is overly petty or intense, random or anxiety-laden to be of interest. Our acquaintances have an understandable expectation, which it would be unwise to disabuse them of what their friends should be normal. We must operate with a degree of politeness, too. No one finds rage or obsession, peculiarity or bitterness especially charming. We can&#x2019;t act up or rant. A radical editing of our true selves is the price we must pay for conviviality. We have to accept too that much of who we are won&#x2019;t readily be understood. Some of our deepest concerns will be met with blank incomprehension, boredom or fear. Most people won&#x2019;t care. Our deeper thoughts will be of scant interest. We will have to subsist as pleasant but radically abbreviated paragraphs in the minds of almost everyone. Love promises to correct all these quietly soul-destroying aspects of single life. In the company of a lover, there need be almost no limits to the depths of concern, care, and licence we are granted. We will be accepted more or less as we are; we won&#x2019;t be under pressure to keep proving our status. It will be possible to reveal our vulnerabilities and compulsions and survive. It will be OK to have tantrums, to sing badly or to cry. We will be tolerated if we are less than charming or simply vile for a time. We will be able to wake up our lover at odd hours to share sorrows or excitements. Our smallest scratches will be of interest. We will be able to raise topics of awe-inspiring minuteness (it won&#x2019;t have been like this since early childhood, the last time kindly others expended serious energy discussing whether the top button on our cardigan should be done up or left open). In the presence of the lover, evaluation will no longer be so swift and cynical. They will lavish time on us. As we tentatively allude to something, they will become eager and excited. They will say &#x2018;go on&#x2019; when we stumble and hesitate. They won&#x2019;t just say &#x2018;poor you&#x2019; and turn away. They will search out relevant details; they will piece together an accurate picture that does justice to our inner lives. The fragile parts of ourselves will be in safe hands. We will feel immense gratitude to this person who does something that we might have come to suspect would be impossible: to know us really well and still like us. We will have escaped from that otherwise dominant and devastating sense that the only way to get people to like us is to conceal most of who we are. We will start to feel as if we exist. Our identity will be safe; we won&#x2019;t be the only guardians of our story. When the world&#x2019;s disinterest chills and erodes us, we will be able to return to the lover to be put back together again, reflected back to ourselves in terms that reassure and console us. Surrounded on all sides by lesser or greater varieties of coldness, we will at last know that, in the arms of one extraordinary, patient and kindly being worthy of infinite gratitude, we truly matter.</p></p><h2>Incredible Vegan Ice Cream: Decadent, All-Natural Flavors Made with Coconut Milk</h2><p><p><b>Your New Favorite Ice Cream Has Arrived</b></p><p>Dig into FoMu Ice Cream&#x2019;s most popular flavors without waiting in line for a cone.

I like how he drew from different streams instead of just representing one stream or denominational viewpoint. James is a diligent student of the Word of God and the ways of God. His years of experience and years of study are reflected in this book. I love to be around bright people who are full of the Spirit and who value hearing from God. James was the first prophet whom I sat with and asked for prayer and activation in the prophetic. I sense God is readying the church for a new visitation. When He comes near, we experience more of His grace as empowerment through the expressions of grace seen in the gifts of the Holy Spirit. I sense this is the hour to no longer be satisfied with knowing about the grace gifts of God--God wants us to understand how to hear from Him and to act on His behalf through His divine enablements, His gifts. I am grateful to James for this labor of love that helps to clarify for many who are just now coming to the Master's banquet table the importance and the value of His gifts, and the way to begin flowing and growing in them.<br><b>--Randy Clark, D.

Through a careful reconstruction of events, first-person accounts, period illustrations, and maps, and by providing information on the exact locations of more than fifty battles, <em>King Philip's War</em> is useful as well as informative. Students of history, colonial war buffs, those interested in Native American history, and anyone who is curious about how this war affected a particular New England town, will find important insights into one of the most seminal events to shape the American mind and continent. 25 b&amp;w photographs and 10 maps</p><p>Now largely forgotten, the massacres of 1675 to 1676, known as King Philip's War, ended the harmonious relations that had existed between native Americans and the colonists since their arrival at Plymouth Rock in 1620. Tensions had been rising as the number of settlers grew, and the pillaging of an outlying farm by affronted young braves escalated into open hostilities. Pitched battles were fought from Rhode Island to Maine. Hundreds of English died as farmers fled and cowered behind stockades or in the few port towns. Thousands of natives were slaughtered and the rest dispersed or sold into slavery in the West Indies. The savagery resulted in the clearing of the native populations from southern New England and the unopposed expansion of the New England colonies. It also became the brutal model on which the United States came to deal with its native peoples. <i>King Philip's War</i> tells the story with such close attention to detail that each ambush, each burned-out farm, becomes a vivid image. The authors make abundant use of maps and photographs of old sites to enable the reader to follow the course of the war: the book forms an exhaustive guide for the armchair historian or anyone wishing to visit the monuments and battlefields today. The terror and bitterness of the period live again in the book's illustrations of old woodcuts and lithographs and in quotations from contemporary narratives. That King Philip, whose head was paraded around the streets of Plymouth in a barbarous show of triumph, was the son of the Wampanoag chief who celebrated the first Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims in 1621 adds to the irony and tragedy of the events, whose memory this well-researched book deservedly keeps alive. <i>--John Stevenson</i><p>Educated at Brown and Harvard, <strong>Eric B.

Schulz, the most widely syndicated and beloved cartoonist of all time, is also one of the least understood figures in American culture. Now, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis gives us the first full-length biography of the brilliant, unseen man behind <i>Peanuts</i>: at once a creation story, a portrait of a native genius, and a chronicle contrasting the private man with the central role he played in shaping the national imagination. <i>Schulz and Peanuts</i> is the definitive epic biography of an American icon and the unforgettable characters he created. </p></p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, October 2007: There's no book this year that made people's eyes light up when I told them about it more than <i>Schulz and Peanuts</i>, David Michaelis's new biography of cartoonist Charles Schulz. (And when they saw the obvious-but-brilliant Chip Kidd-designed cover, their eyes got even brighter.) Everyone, it seems, feels a personal connection to Peanuts (a name, by the way, that Schulz always hated), but few have a sense of the artist whose small troupe of big-headed characters still lives at the center of our imagination. If some mystery about the man still remains after reading Michaelis's sharp, engaging, and level-headed biography that's no fault of the biographer--in fact, it's to his credit. Michaelis parses Schulz's particular combination of Midwestern reserve and steely determination and the strip's still-surprising balance of exuberance and misery, and he reminds us what a colossal cultural force it became, especially in the 1960s. But even as he ingeniously finds sources for Schulz's four-panel vignettes in the events of his biography, he recognizes that the true, sometimes inexplicable drama of his life took place when he sat down every day for 50 years to trace Linus's wobbly strands of hair, fill in Snoopy's black nose, and, time and again, letter the words "Good grief." <i>--Tom Nissley</i><p>David Michaelis is the author of two bestselling biographies, including <em>N. C. Wyeth</em> (available from Harper Perennial), which won the Ambassador Book Award for Biography and Autobiography, given by the English-Speaking Union of the United States.

Journalist and scholar Bernard Fall vividly captured the sights, sounds, and smells of the brutal&#x2014; and politically complicated&#x2014;conflict between the French and the Communist-led Vietnamese nationalists in Indochina. The French fought to the bitter end, but even with the lethal advantages of a modern military, they could not stave off the Viet Minh insurgency of hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, booby traps, and nighttime raids. The final French defeat came at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, setting the stage for American involvement and a far bloodier chapter in Vietnam&#x2018;s history. Fall combined graphic reporting with deep scholarly knowledge of Vietnam and its colonial history in a book memorable in its descriptions of jungle fighting and insightful in its arguments. After more than a half a century in print, Street without Joy remains required reading.</p><p>Bernard Fall was born in Vienna in 1926, migrating to France in 1938. After his father was killed by the Gestapo and his mother killed at Auschwitz, he joined the French Resistance at sixteen, then the French Army. Following World War II, he was an analyst with the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. Coming to the U.S. in the early 1950s, he earned a masters and a doctorate at Syracuse. He first traveled to Indochina in 1953, returning in 1957, 1962, 1965, 1966, and 1967, when he was killed by a mine on the &#x201c;street without joy,&#x201d; the highway he had described in his book.

But the way these mathematical breakthroughs have contributed to human progress is seldom appreciated. In <i>In Pursuit of the Unknown,</i> celebrated mathematician Ian Stewart untangles the roots of our most important mathematical statements to show that equations have long been a driving force behind nearly every aspect of our lives.<br>Using seventeen of our most crucial equations--including the Wave Equation that allowed engineers to measure a building's response to earthquakes, saving countless lives, and the Black-Scholes model, used by bankers to track the price of financial derivatives over time--Stewart illustrates that many of the advances we now take for granted were made possible by mathematical discoveries.<br>An approachable, lively, and informative guide to the mathematical building blocks of modern life, <i>In Pursuit of the Unknown </i>is a penetrating exploration of how we have also used equations to make sense of, and in turn influence, our world.<br></p><p><b>Ian Stewart</b> is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics and active researcher at the University of Warwick.

The wolf, the owl, and the starry sky all have their reasons, but the moon ultimately answers for herself -- her light is meant to be shared by everyone. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Krans's stunning ink-and-watercolor illustrations beautifully illuminate this simple exploration of our relationship to the world around us and our place in it.</p><p>KIM KRANS is an artist, writer, and yogi living in Portland, Oregon with her husband, Arjan.

Many stake a claim on the orb, from a bird, a bear, and a wolf to a tree, a mountain, and the starry sky. In the end, the moon says it shines "for one and all, and none, throughout eternity." Told in the "Alouette" verse form, this is an original tale and a slight departure from Krans's concept books ABC Dream and 123 Dream. Full spreads bring the nocturnal world alive, with the night sky backgrounds in watercolor with a palette that incorporates the magical colors and movement of the aurora borealis. Each spread focuses on one particular subject and its connection with the moon. Krans's signature intricate pen-and-ink illustrations are larger-than-life, such as an image of a bear looking straight at readers, the moon dropping behind her as she says she found the moon first and doesn't "like to share." VERDICT Though much of the story line feels familiar, the art is winsome, and young readers will be enchanted with the enthralling night world that Krans has created.

But in the second century, its future was not at all certain.&nbsp; Initially Christianity possessed little social or cultural influence and found itself fighting for its life. While apostolic tradition was emerging as a "rule of faith," factions contested the nature of the gospel, and pagan philosophers found its claims scandalous. And while its pathway was tenuous, Christianity was forming structures of leadership and worship, and a core of apostolic texts was emerging as authoritative. But it was the challenges, obstacles, and transitions faced by Christians in the second century that, in many ways, would determine the future of the church for the next two millennia. It was a time when Christianity stood at a crossroads. Michael Kruger's introductory survey examines how Christianity took root in the second century, how it battled to stay true to the vision of the apostles, and how it developed in ways that would shape both the church and Western culture over the next two thousand years. <em>Christianity at the Crossroads</em> provides an accessible and informative look at the complex and foundational issues faced by an infant church still trying to determine its identity. The church's response to the issues of heresy and orthodoxy, the development of the canon, and the transmission of the Christian Scriptures not only determined its survival, but determined the kind of church it would be for generations to come.</p><p>"If you've ever wondered what happened to the church after the apostles, how the church began to expand and grow, and why it developed its particular beliefs, then Michael Kruger has written the book for you. In this learned volume, Kruger takes readers into the mysterious second century, where he lucidly explains things like the formation of a distinctive Christian identity, pagan responses to Christianity, the rise of certain heresies, and the canonization of the New Testament. This book will open a whole new world that you never knew existed!" (Michael F. Bird, lecturer in theology, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"This is a good introduction and overview of Christianity in the second century, which was a crucial period of growth, opposition, and development of doctrines and practices. Readable and informed, Kruger's book is a recommended choice for course readings and for individuals seeking to know more about early Christianity." (Larry W. Hurtado, professor emeritus of New Testament language, literature, and theology, School of Divinity (New College), University of Edinburgh)<br><br>"Kruger takes us into a world in which 'Christianity' is still very much at risk and up for grabs, struggling to find its identity in the midst of forces within and without seeking to define its identity or suppress its existence. His book invites us into the tensions and trajectories that would eventually give shape to what we, in distant retrospect, take for granted as Christian faith, practice, and polity. I recommend it highly, alongside the texts that have richly informed it (the apostolic fathers, the early martyrologies, and the apologists), to all those interested in learning how 'New Testament faith' found its footing and began to take root." (David A. deSilva, trustees' distinguished professor of New Testament and Greek, Ashland Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Though most of us are pretty sure that something happened between the apostolic era and the Council of Nicaea, even professional historians can be pretty foggy on what that 'something' was or why it matters; the second century has always been the black box of Christian history. Now with this well-researched yet highly accessible book, Kruger recovers important flight data that shows just how crucial this overlooked trajectory is to understanding Christian history and even Christianity as we know it today." (Nicholas Perrin, Franklin S. Dyrness Professor of Biblical Studies, Wheaton Graduate School)<br><br>"The second century, a sprawling, fascinating, and formative period in the history of Christianity, may be well studied, but it is neither well nor easily comprehended. Mike Kruger's <em>Christianity at the Crossroads</em> is an excellent remedy for that problem! Any reader who wants a better understanding of the situation of the church in that period, its place in the world, its worship, its struggles, and its Scriptures will benefit from this highly informative compendium. Besides being a trustworthy guidebook, it is also a well-designed source-book for those interested in further study." (Charles E. Hill, John R. Richardson Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity, Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando)<br><br>"Many scholars of early Christianity are pushing beyond the New Testament era, into the second century; however, the complexity of issues magnifies due to the intersection of such a diverse expression of Christian groups interpreting biblical texts and developing their approaches to theology and society. With <em>Christianity at the Crossroads</em>, Michael Kruger provides an orientation to the diversity of groups, texts, and practices that students and scholars of Christian origins will find invaluable. He summarizes the best of contemporary research about second century Christianity and provides robust bibliographies for further study. This is definitely a book I wish I had a decade ago, when I began my work in this area." (Ben C. Blackwell, assistant professor of Christianity, Houston Baptist University)Michael J. Kruger (PhD, University of Edinburgh) is president and professor of New Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. His recent publications include <em>The Question of Canon</em> and <em>The Early Text of the New Testament</em>, coedited with Charles E. Hill.</p><h2>The Way Home</h2><p>"I have a tale to tell. A tale of a girl who once was, and the journey she took to find her way back home. There was only one problem... she had destroyed her home. Stories of restored marriages are usually told from the pen of the conquering hero. But this time is different. This story is being told from the heart of the villain. The story you are about to read is true, for I was that villain. I was the one who left home and had to try and find my way back." What if right now your life could change forever? This possibility is not as far fetched as you might think. I want to tell you a story &#x2013; my story &#x2013; and how in one moment everything in my life changed. I want to give you a front row seat to my journey of veering away from God&#x2019;s plan, going on my own path, and how I recalibrate and found my way back home. Some of you may be faced with the same decision right now: His way or mine. His plan or mine. I want to share with you my experience of what lies ahead and how you can have the life you&#x2019;ve imagined. Some others might be in the greatest fight you&#x2019;ve ever faced. You are praying and believing for a prodigal to come home but many tell you to accept things the way they are, that there is nothing you can do to change it. I&#x2019;m here to tell you otherwise. Will your prodigal come home? Only God has that answer. But can they? Can He really reach your loved one who has become a different person right in front of your very eyes? Can He actually change and transform them after everything they have done, after all the lines they have crossed, after they have said and done things you never dreamed they would do? Absolutely.</p><p></p><h2>Rail-Trails Michigan &amp; Wisconsin: The definitive guide to the region's top multiuse trails</h2><p><b>Explore 63 of the best rail-trails and multiuse pathways across two states.</b> <br><br>All around the country, unused railroad corridors have been converted to public multiuse trails.

The teachers buzzed against the far wall of the gymnasium, checking their watches and craning their necks. Cameron sat next to Ronnie in the top corner of the bleachers. He bit his fingernails and watched everyone spin about. His left pinky finger, already cracked and dry, began to bleed around the cuticle.<br> &#x201c;What do you think this is for?&#x201d; Ronnie said. Ronnie never brushed his teeth in the morning. There were zits around the corners of his mouth, and they were white and full at the edges. Cameron leaned away.<br> Principal Barnes stood at the podium on the half-court line, adjusting his jacket. The ninth-grade class snapped their gum and laughed in little groups, hiking up their backpacks and squeaking colorful shoes across the gymnasium floor.<br> &#x201c;Can everyone hear me?&#x201d; Principal Barnes said, hands on each side of the podium. He brushed a line of sweat from his forehead with his sleeve, squeezed his eyes shut.<br> &#x201c;Jefferson High School is in the midst of a tragedy,&#x201d; Principal Barnes said. &#x201c;Last night, we were forced to say good-bye to one of our most gifted students. It is with regret that I inform you of the passing of your classmate, Miss Lucinda Hayes.&#x201d;<br> The microphone shrieked, crackled.<br> In the days following, Cameron would remember this as the moment he lost her. The hum of the overhead fluorescent lights created a rhythm in time with the whispers that blossomed from every direction. If this moment were a song, Cameron thought, it would be a quiet song&#x2014;the sort of song that drowned you in your own miserable chest. It was stunning and tender. It dropped, it shattered, and Cameron could only feel the weight of this melody, this song that felt both crushing and delicate.<br> &#x201c;Fuck<i>,</i>&#x201d; Ronnie whispered. The song built and built and built, a steady rush.<br> It took Cameron six more seconds to notice that no one had a face.<br> He leaned over the edge of the bleachers and vomited through the railings.<br> Last night: Almond eyes glaring out onto the lawn. A pink palm spread wide on Lucinda&#x2019;s bedroom window screen. The clouds overhead, moving in fast, a gray sheet shaken out over midnight suede.<br> &#x201c;The nurse said you threw up,&#x201d; Mom said when she picked him up, later that afternoon.<br> Cameron nudged the crushed crackers and lint on the carpet of the minivan, pushing them into small mountains with the side of his snow boot. Mom took a sip of coffee from her travel mug.<br> After the initial drama had simmered down, everyone had gathered outside the gymnasium to speculate. The baseball boys said she was raped. The loser girls said she killed herself. Ronnie had agreed. <i>She probably killed herself, don&#x2019;t you think? She was always writing in that journal. I bet she left a note. Dude, your fucking throw-up is on my shoe. </i><br> &#x201c;Cameron,&#x201d; Mom tried again, three streets later. She was using her sympathetic voice. Mom had the sort of sympathetic voice that Cameron hated&#x2014;it seeped from her throat in sugary spurts. He hated to imagine his sadness inside her. Mom didn&#x2019;t deserve any of it.<br> &#x201c;I know this is hard. This shouldn&#x2019;t happen to people your age&#x2014; especially not to girls like Lucinda.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Mom. Stop.&#x201d;<br> Cameron rested his forehead against the frosted window. He wondered if a forehead print was like a fingerprint. It was probably less identifiable, because foreheads weren&#x2019;t necessarily different from person to person, un- less you were looking at the print on a microscopic level, and how often did people take the time for that?<br> He wondered how it would feel to kiss someone through glass. He&#x2019;d seen a movie once about a guy who kissed his wife through a jail visitation- room window and he&#x2019;d wondered if that felt like a real kiss. He thought a kiss was more about the intention than the act, so it hardly mattered if saliva hit glass or more saliva.<br> Since he was thinking about lips, he was thinking about Lucinda Hayes and hating himself, because Lucinda Hayes was dead.<br> When they got home, Mom sat him down on the couch. She turned on the television. <i>Get your mind off things. </i>She emptied a can of chicken noodle soup into a bowl, but over the whir of the microwave, the voice of the news anchor blared.<br> &#x201c;Tragedy struck in northern Colorado this morning, where the body of a fifteen-year-old girl was discovered on an elementary-school playground. The victim has been identified as Lucinda Hayes, a ninth-grade student at Jefferson High School. The staff member who made the horrific find offered no comment. The investigation will continue under the direction of Lieutenant Timothy Gonzalez of the Broomsville Police Department. Civilians are encouraged to report any suspicious behavior.&#x201d;<br> Lucinda&#x2019;s eighth-grade yearbook photo smiled down from the corner of the television screen, her face flat and pixelated. The remote dropped from Cameron&#x2019;s hand to the coffee table&#x2014;the back popped off, and three AAA batteries rolled noisily along the table and onto the carpet.<br> &#x201c;Cameron?&#x201d; Mom called from the kitchen.<br> He knew that park, the elementary school down the block. It was just behind their cul-de-sac, halfway between his house and Lucinda&#x2019;s.<br> Before Mom could reach him, Cameron was stumbling down the hall, opening his bedroom door. He couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to turn on the lights&#x2014; he was ripping the sheets off his bed, he was pulling his sketchbook and charcoals and kneaded eraser from their hiding spot beneath his mattress.<br> He ripped out the sketchbook pages one by one and spread them in a circle around his bedroom floor. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the dark of his room, but when they did, he was surrounded by Lucinda Hayes.<br> In most of the drawings, she was happy. In most of the drawings, it was sunny, and one side of her face was lighter than the other. The left, always the left. In most of the drawings, she was smiling wholly&#x2014;not like in the yearbook photo, where the photographer caught her before she was herself.<br> Lucinda&#x2019;s face was easy to draw from memory. Her cheekbones were high and bright. The lines near Lucinda&#x2019;s mouth gave her the appearance of effortless happiness. Her lashes were thick and winged outward, so if Cameron skewed the shape of her eyes or set them too deep beneath her brow line, you could still tell it was Lucinda. In most of the drawings, her mouth was open in laughter; you could see the gap between her two front teeth. Cameron loved that gap. It unclothed her.<br> Cameron pressed his eyes to his kneecaps. He could not look at Lucinda like this because he had missed her most important parts: The way her legs flew out when she ran, from all those years of ballet. How her hair got frizzy at the front when she walked home from school in the heat. The way she sat at her kitchen table after school, listening to music on her shiny pink MP3 player, drumming white-painted fingernails against the marble. He always imagined she listened to oldies because he thought they fit her. <i>Little bitty pretty one</i>. Cameron had missed the way she squinted when she couldn&#x2019;t see the board in class, the creases at the corners of her eyes like plastic blinds she had opened to let in the sunlight.<br> He couldn&#x2019;t look at Lucinda like this because now she was dead, and all he had were the useless things&#x2014;a smeared charcoal iris. A pinky finger drawn quickly, slightly too thin.<br> &#x201c;Oh God, Cam,&#x201d; Mom whispered from the doorway. &#x201c;Oh, God.&#x201d;<br> Mom stood with her hands on the doorframe, taking in his ring of drawings, looking like she might crumple. Her pink, striped sweater looked fake and sad, and Cameron wanted to melt her right into him so she wouldn&#x2019;t look so old. The way Mom&#x2019;s hands clung to the doorframe reminded Cameron of when he was a kid and Mom did ballet in the basement. She used the dirty windowsill as a barre and put her Mozart tapes in the cassette player. She whispered to herself. <i>And one and two and three and four. Jet�, jet�, pas de bourr�e. </i>Cameron watched through the railing of the basement stairs. Her old back never straightened, and her old toes never pointed, and she looked like a bird with a body of broken bones. It made him sad to watch her dance because she looked so fragile and so expressive and so happy and so fragmented, all at once. Mom looked like herself when she danced; he had always thought so.<br> Cameron wanted to tell Mom that he was sorry for all of this. But he could not, because of the horrified way she was looking at his collection of Lucinda.<br> Cameron put his head back on his knees and kept it there until he was sure Mom had gone.</p><h2>Not Broken: An Approachable Guide to Miscarriage and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss</h2><p>Not Broken is a comprehensive, evidence-based but easy-to-read guide for anyone who wants to understand all aspects of miscarriage and recurrent pregnancy loss.

Dr. Shahine explains medical terms with compassion and care, understanding the emotional impact multiple miscarriages can have. She highlights not only the advancements in Western medicine such as IVF, but Eastern ones as well, along with lifestyle choices that could help decrease the risk of miscarriage. Throughout the book, Dr. Shahine reveals herself as a strong advocate for pregnant women, reassuring them that such early losses are rarely the mother's fault and, empowered with the knowledge detailed in Not Broken, they can feel more hopeful than ever about continuing their family goals.&nbsp;<br><br>The title for <i>Not Broken</i> is based on kintsugi, a Japanese art form in which broken pottery is repaired with gold or silver. It is a philosophy that embraces the cracks as something that should be highlighted, not hidden.&nbsp;Such a sentiment is the foundation of Dr. Shahine's work and, in a world where every aspect of pregnancy from the sex of the child and beyond is blamed solely on the mother, Dr. Shahine breaks that misconception and works to ease the burden of guilt as well as provide practical easy-to-understand solutions.

For any couple, losing a baby through miscarriage can be a harrowing experience and some people go through this several times. The stress that follows, the emotional pain, the uncertainty, and the acute sense of loss are among the experiences that many couples go through. Sometimes victims of miscarriage are at a loss over what to think or do and they ask the question why?&nbsp;<br><br>In this book, the author brings in a lot of knowledge and offers the advice that women with recurrent issues of miscarriage need to hear.

In fact, a large percentage of first trimester abortions have nothing at all to do with the mother and father of the child and everything to do with a mistake in the chromosomes of the embryo. Finding out more about how this occurs and just what it means for the couple is one way to start feeling a little better about the whole terrible ordeal of going through a miscarriage. For the couple, understanding is the key to slowly overcoming their pain and being able to move forward with starting the family they want. And all of that is the purpose of Not Broken by Dr. Lora Shahine.<br><br><i>Not Broken: An Approachable Guide to Miscarriage and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss</i> is for all those women who are trying to have a baby, but don't understand miscarriage, or those many women who have had the difficult experience of going through one or more miscarriages of their own. For these women, it can be nearly impossible to move on from the event or to understand that they, themselves, may not have been at fault for anything that happened. This book is about helping you understand what a miscarriage is and many of the different things that could contribute to a miscarriage. By making it less confusing, Dr. Lora Shahine strives to make the process a little more bearable and the couple a little more prepared for what they can and should be doing." - Samantha Dewitt (Rivera) for Readers' Favorite</p><h2>Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt: A Novel</h2><p>Having completed the two cycles of legend to which she has devoted her career so far, Anne Rice gives us now her most ambitious and courageous book, a novel about the early years of CHRIST THE LORD, based on the Gospels and on the most respected New Testament scholarship.<br><br>The book&#x2019;s power derives from the passion its author brings to the writing and the way in which she summons up the voice, the presence, the words of Jesus who tells the story.</p><p>Motion picture rights to Christ the Lord, Out of Egypt, have been optioned by Cyrus and Betsy Nowrasteh and Chris Columbus of the 1492 company.

Carril coached the perennial Ivy League powerhouse for 29 seasons before his 1996 retirement, and his hardwood hard line couldn't have been simpler: play smart. Of course, it helped that his players were smart enough--they <i>did</i> get into Princeton--to compensate for any lack of size and talent. Carril preached winning through intelligence, selfless play, and dogged defense. <i>The Smart Take from the Strong</i> is his bible. While it makes a pass here and there at biography, the book's beauty is the keenness of its Carrilion collection of on- and off-the-court parables and beatitudes. How can you turn a deaf ear to eternal verities such as "Bad shooters are always open" and "The ability to rebound is in inverse proportion to the distance your house is from the nearest railroad tracks"? And how can you not love a coach who can suggest, when pondering why the university kept rehiring him, "I think they kept me because some of my players seemed to be better people for the experience," and <i>not</i> have it sound like a crow?"Pete Carril is the Stonewall Jackson of ncaa basketball&#x2014;unbelievable in victory, unforgettable in defeat."&#x2014;John McPhee.

One of them, a boy named Hades, was walking backward and talking to the others.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is a snake&#x2019;s favorite thing to study?&#x201d; curly-haired Hades asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, animal science?&#x201d; guessed one of the other Olympians, Athena, a girl with thoughtful gray eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope! Hiss-tory. Get it? Hisssssss-tory?&#x201d; Hades repeated, and then he started laughing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha-ha,&#x201d; replied Hephaestus in a flat voice. The boy walked with the help of a cane carved with skulls and topped with a skull-shaped knob.<br> <br>The fourth Olympian and the leader of the group, Zeus, frowned. &#x201c;Hades, I don&#x2019;t mind the jokes, but do they have to be all snake jokes?&#x201d; the black haired, blue-eyed leader complained.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Bro,&#x201d; Hades replied sheepishly. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve got a snake thing. But I guess I&#x2019;ve got snakes on my mind, seeing as how we just took down a monster lady with snakes for hair.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though Hades and the others looked like mortal boys and girls, they were actually immortal, and their actions were courageous beyond their years. Their biggest mission was to stop their enemies&#x2014;the giant King Cronus and the king&#x2019;s band of minions, the half-giant Cronies&#x2014;from taking over the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, but I believe I took down the monster with snakes for hair,&#x201d; Hephaestus pointed out, waving his cane. &#x201c;I left her in pieces!&#x201d;<br> <br>Athena shook her head. &#x201c;Oh, really? Because I was the one who tricked her into looking into my aegis so that she turned herself into a stone statue first.&#x201d; She patted the gold shield that she wore on her chest, covered by her cloak. &#x201c;Beating up a statue is not such a big deal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hephaestus&#x2019;s cheeks flushed. &#x201c;Well, she was a scary statue.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus rolled his eyes as his two friends continued to bicker over who had actually slain the green-haired Medusa.<br> <br>At least it&#x2019;s better than the snake jokes, he thought.<br> <br>The four of them were heading back to a village that they had just left the day before. So much had happened in the last twenty-four hours.<br> <br>Twelve Olympians had started off on another quest given to them by Pythia. She was the Oracle of Delphi, and she could see the future&#x2014;if not always clearly. (Sometimes her foggy spectacles made it so she couldn&#x2019;t see well, which meant her instructions could be a little confusing!) Pythia had seen that Zeus and the other young Olympians, all of them gods with special powers, would one day overthrow evil King Cronus, who ruled the Terrible Titans.<br> <br>The twelve Olympians hadn&#x2019;t always been together. Zeus had gone on his first quest with only two others, Poseidon and Hera. On each new quest they fought monsters and other mythical beasts. They found magical items. And they added new Olympians to their group.<br> <br>All twelve of them had traveled to the village yesterday. Pythia had told them to look for &#x201c;hairy snakes.&#x201d; Nobody had known exactly what that meant, so the twelve had split up into three groups to try to hunt down the hairy snakes. Now that Zeus&#x2019;s group had succeeded, they were trying to meet back up with the other two groups.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s the village up ahead,&#x201d; Athena announced. &#x201c;I wonder if anybody else is back yet? I hope they remembered that this is our meeting place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re probably still out looking for hairy snakes, because they don&#x2019;t exist!&#x201d; Hephaestus said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re the only ones who got it right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A monster with snakes for hair,&#x201d; Hades said. &#x201c;I think it was a good look for her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus smiled. His brother Hades was also ruler of the Underworld. He liked creepy things.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the others beat us back here,&#x201d; Zeus said. &#x201c;At least I hope so.&#x201d;<br> <br>The village was bustling with people shopping at the market stalls. Hades shook the cloth pouch dangling from his belt, and it made a jingling sound.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got plenty of gold coins,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get some more of that stinky cheese that I got yesterday!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not if you want to hang out with us,&#x201d; came a voice behind them.<br> <br>Zeus, Hades, Hephaestus, and Athena turned around. Four of their Olympian friends stood there: Hera, Hestia, Demeter, and Poseidon!<br> <br>The girl speaking was Hera, Zeus&#x2019;s blond-haired, blue-eyed (and sometimes bossy) sister. Hades ran up to her and gave her a hug.<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys are back!&#x201d; he cried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, there were no hairy snakes in the mountains,&#x201d; Hera reported.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just a lot of goats,&#x201d; Poseidon added.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you find the hairy snakes?&#x201d; asked Demeter.<br> <br>&#x201c;We did,&#x201d; Zeus said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s kind of a long story.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We want to hear it,&#x201d; Hestia said. &#x201c;But I think we&#x2019;re all hungry. I&#x2019;ll go make a fire over there, and we can talk while we eat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hestia pointed to a meadow just beyond the village.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help you,&#x201d; Athena offered.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll help Hades do the shopping, so we don&#x2019;t end up eating a whole bunch of stinky cheese,&#x201d; added Hera.<br> <br>Hades shook his head. &#x201c;You have no taste.&#x201d;<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t long before the eight Olympians were gathered around a small fire, started by Hestia and her magic torch. They roasted sausages on sticks and ate chunks of cheese while Zeus, Hephaestus, Athena, and Hades told their story. They explained how a young thief, Perseus, had led them to Medusa, a monster with snakes for hair&#x2014;Pythia&#x2019;s &#x201c;hairy snakes.&#x201d; Athena had tricked Medusa and turned her into a statue.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, after my cane destroyed the statue, this horse with wings came flying out of it,&#x201d; Hephaestus said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A winged horse? Cool!&#x201d; said Poseidon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not cool,&#x201d; said Zeus. &#x201c;He grabbed Bolt and flew away with it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Demeter gasped. &#x201c;No! You have to get Bolt back!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bolt was one of Zeus&#x2019;s magical objects. After Zeus had pulled Bolt from a stone at Delphi, he had used Bolt on all of their big quests. The lightning- shaped dagger could grow large or small at Zeus&#x2019;s command. It had saved the Olympians from many monsters&#x2014;and now it was gone.<br> <br>Zeus nodded. &#x201c;The horse flew toward this village. But we can&#x2019;t look for him until we find the others.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And Pythia might have a new quest for us,&#x201d; Athena reminded him.<br> <br>Poseidon looked around. &#x201c;No sign of her yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She might be waiting until all twelve of us are together again,&#x201d; Hera guessed.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got four and four, but we need four more,&#x201d; Hades quipped.<br> <br>Zeus looked back at the village. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anyone here yet from our group. Maybe we should ask if anyone has seen them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Hestia pointed to Zeus. &#x201c;Look! Chip is glowing!&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus looked down at the smooth oval stone that he wore around his neck. Chip was his second magical object and helped guide the Olympians in the right direction. Right now a big red C was glowing on the stone.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s new,&#x201d; Hera remarked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chip&#x2019;s trying to tell us something,&#x201d; Athena said. &#x201c;Do you think the C stands for &#x2018;Cronies&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly the group heard a commotion in the distance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, yeah, Bro.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think that C definitely stands for &#x2018;Cronies,&#x2019; &#x201d; Hades said, staring past Zeus. His pale face was even paler than usual as he pointed a shaking finger toward the village.<br> <br>Zeus looked up from Chip. He could hear screaming. Out of nowhere, three hulking half-giants, soldiers of King Cronus, stomped through the market.<br> <br>Zeus reached for Bolt around his waist out of habit&#x2014;but of course it wasn&#x2019;t there. &#x201c;Quick! Put out our fire!&#x201d; he yelled.</p><h2>Monster Musume Vol. 5</h2><p><p>Udder Madness!</p><p>"Get married and I kill you."

In the midst of the acrimonious swirl, Hamilton cautiously, carefully, and judiciously works his way through the so-called history books of the Old Testament. Hamilton knows all about current scholarly issues but is more interested in the text itself, the way it works, and the way the past is rendered imaginatively. As a consequence, students will find here a clear guide in considering the detail and claim of the text itself, at least for now not needing to engage the scholarly debates that focus outside the text and outside its claims."--<b>Walter Brueggemann</b>, Columbia Theological Seminary<br><br>"<i>Handbook on the Historical Books</i> manages to steer between the oversimplified approaches found in many evangelical texts and the complex and speculative theories found in many critical studies of Hebrew historiography.

For those who wish to do additional research, each chapter is appended with a bibliography of recent, relevant scholarship. &#34;Professor Hamilton has provided college students and anyone else serious about studying the historiographic books of the Old Testament with an excellent introduction. His careful attention to style and message bring these ancient writings to life.&#34; -Daniel I. Block, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary &#34;Victor Hamilton&#39;s Handbook on the Historical Books continues the fine work he began in his Handbook on the Pentateuch.

But when a Hollywood power broker and his mistress are found dead in the abandoned Murder House, the gruesome crime scene rivals anything Jenna experienced in Manhattan. And what at first seems like an open and shut case turns out to have as many shocking secrets as the Murder House itself, as Jenna quickly realizes that the mansion's history is much darker than even the town's most salacious gossips could have imagined. <br>As more bodies surface, and the secret that Jenna has tried desperately to escape closes in on her, she must risk her own life to expose the truth-before the Murder House claims another victim.

Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, attended the laying of the keel of the USS<i> Arizona</i> at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Writing with vivid intimacy, Nelson traces Japan&#x2019;s leaders as they lurch into ultranationalist fascism, which culminates in their scheme to terrify America with one of the boldest attacks ever waged. Within seconds, the country would never be the same.<br> <br>Backed by a research team&#x2019;s five years of work, as well as Nelson&#x2019;s thorough re-examination of the original evidence assembled by federal investigators, this page-turning and definitive work &#x201c;weaves archival research, interviews, and personal experiences from both sides into a blow-by-blow narrative of destruction liberally sprinkled with individual heroism, bizarre escapes, and equally bizarre tragedies&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>). Nelson delivers all the terror, chaos, violence, tragedy, and heroism of the attack in stunning detail, and offers surprising conclusions about the tragedy&#x2019;s unforeseen and resonant consequences that linger even today.</p><p>Craig Nelson&nbsp;is the author of <i>Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness</i> and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon, </i>as well as several previous books, including <i>The Age of Radiance </i>(a PEN Award Finalist chosen as one of the year&#x2019;s best books by NBC News, the American Institute of Physics, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, and FlavorWire), <i>The First Heroes, Thomas Paine </i>(winner of the Henry Adams Prize), and <i>Let&#x2019;s Get Lost</i> (shortlisted for W.H. Smith&#x2019;s Book of the Year). His writing has appeared in <i>Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal, Salon, National Geographic, The New England Review, Popular Science, Reader&#x2019;s Digest,</i> and a host of other publications.&#x201c;In this brilliant mix of history and emotion, Craig Nelson has managed to combine grueling research with masterful reporting in order to capture the long and the short, the overview and the detail, of that infamous day in a paradisal land of orchids and jacaranda. It has taken seventy-five years, but now, finally, <i>the</i> Pearl Harbor book has been written.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jim deFilippi, author of <i>Mules of Monte Cassino</i> and <i>Murka</i></b><br><br>"Craig Nelson has completely retold the epic story of Pearl Harbor. Using his skills as a reporter and a literary stylist, he not only deftly paints the fleeting image&#x2014;an enemy pilot waving as he flies by, a cup of coffee trembling on a table while outside a war commences&#x2014;but a world roiled in titanic struggle. His gifts as storyteller, his empathy and scope, will appeal to fans of Walter Lord&#x2019;s <i>Day of Infamy</i> or Cornelius Ryan&#x2019;s <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>, and, in surprise, the inquiry of Lawrence Wright&#x2019;s <i>The Looming Tower</i>.

Dexter plays the mummy, Carmen is the princess, and Fox is the hero, of course&#x2014;but that's not what makes him a star! Whether putting on a play, making a film for Grannie, or going to a magic show, Fox struts in the spotlight, with hilarious results.</p><p>James Marshall was&nbsp;one of the most prolific and successful author/illustrators of children's books. He was best known for his series on the mischievous exploits of Fox, a debonair, lazy showoff; the uproarious adventures of the two Cut-Ups, Spud and Joe; George and Martha; and the misadventures of the Stupidfamily.&nbsp;He divided his time between an apartment in the Chelsea district of New York and his home in Mansfield Hollow Connecticut.To an adult mourning Marshall's passing, there's a bittersweet irony to these tales of the unquenchable Fox, whose self-confidence lands him in one pickle after another; each cloud that eclipses Fox here has a silver lining. To his friends, Fox's conceited video (``Me, flossing my teeth'') is ``dumb,'' but Grannie Fox and little sister Louise ``just love it''; when, capping a series of disasters, the curtain falls not only on the play he and his friends are putting on but all over the actors too, it's praised as the ``Funniest thing I ever saw''--which is likely to be the intended audience's response to Fox's latest posturings and pratfalls. Marshall's deft way with very simple, very natural, miraculously funny phrases is perfectly matched by the insidiously caricatured animals performing in his proscenium- arch- and TV-screen-shaped frames. There are plenty of delectable details--a crocodile-librarian poised on a tall library ladder; a theatrical ``mummy,'' a pig garbed in toilet paper. And, again, the comically expressive faces are priceless. One more to treasure. (Easy reader. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Using this evidence-based approach promotes successful rehabilitation and reentry by drawing on clients' values, goals, and strengths--not simply telling them what to do. The authors clearly describe the core techniques of MI and bring them to life with examples and sample dialogues from a range of criminal justice and forensic settings. Of crucial importance, the book addresses MI implementation in real-world offender service systems, including practical strategies for overcoming obstacles.<br><br> This book is in the Applications of Motivational Interviewing series, edited by Stephen Rollnick, William R. Miller, and Theresa B. Moyers.</p><p>Jill D. Stinson, PhD, is Assistant Professor and Director of Clinical Training in the Department of Psychology at East Tennessee State University. She previously served as an administrator and sex offender treatment coordinator at Fulton State Hospital, a maximum- and intermediate security forensic mental health hospital in Missouri. Her research and publications focus on sex offenders with serious mental illness, the role of self-regulation in treatment of personality and severe behavior disorders, and the impact of early childhood trauma in high-risk psychiatric and offender populations.

His website is <i>www.buildmotivation.com</i>."MI has deservedly gained a substantial national and international following because of its positive pathways to creating change. This clearly written, easily accessible book--with examples throughout--explains the philosophy, rationale, strategy, and tactics of applying MI in criminal justice and related settings. Mental health and criminal justice professionals and students who are interested in correctional rehabilitation, probation and parole, offender reentry, restorative justice, or alternative dispute resolution should view this book as essential reading."--Bruce D. Sales, PhD, JD, ScD (h.c.), Virginia L. Roberts Professor, Department of Criminal Justice, Indiana University Bloomington<br><br> "This is a book that many of us have been anticipating for a long time. MI is one of a small number of true evidence-based (and strengths-based!) success stories in offender rehabilitation. This book brings the technique alive in a way that I hope will transform theory and practice in the field."--Shadd Maruna, PhD, Professor of Criminology, University of Manchester, United Kingdom<br><br> "Comprehensive, practical, and easy to read. <i>Motivational Interviewing with Offenders</i> addresses all aspects of the offender change process--assessment, treatment, case management, and supervision. Everything one needs to apply MI is contained in this book. It should be mandatory reading for clinicians; students and interns; parole, probation, and correctional officers; residential staff members; and program administrators and supervisors. Even the most experienced change agent will benefit from the book's respectful approach and plentiful, very helpful examples."--Pamela M. Yates, PhD, Cabot Consulting and Research Services, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada<br><br> "Whether you deliver direct treatment or offender supervision services, manage programs responsible for achieving improved offender outcomes, or design systemwide interventions to improve public safety, this refreshingly readable book articulates a proven way forward. While a court may order treatment, it cannot order lasting change--commitment to real change and long-term recovery is always a choice. This book outlines the essentials for helping an offender to make that choice and move from conflict, to compliance, to commitment. I highly recommend it for anyone working with justice system&#x2013;involved individuals, and especially those working in treatment courts."--Terrence D. Walton, MSW, CSAC, Chief Operating Officer, National Association of Drug Court Professionals<br><br> "Stinson and Clark beautifully illustrate an empirically guided intervention approach that is respectful of offenders' autonomy and capacity to change. They convincingly demonstrate how MI is able to provide people who have committed crimes with the internal and external resources to enhance their quality of life and reduce the chances of further harm to the community. The book is beautifully written, scholarly, and accessible to practitioners, policymakers, and researchers. In my view, this is one of the most important books of the decade on offender rehabilitation."--Tony Ward, PhD, School of Psychology, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand<br><br>"Motivational Interviewing (MI) has a natural home in serving society&#x2019;s most marginalized people, and perhaps no group fits that description as well as sexual offenders....The book presents many practical examples of how to incorporate the spirit of MI into a variety of aspects of sex offender treatment and management, from the first contact with the sex offender to management of them in the community. There is a good balance between practical information and the philosophy behind MI and the rationale for applying it to sex offenders....I would recommend this book to practitioners of all levels of experience and skill. For new therapists, the material is presented in a way that is easily understandable and practical. For the seasoned veteran this book will provide new and different ways to engage clients and remind us to think of our clients as being more than just their offending.&#x201d;, <i>Association for the Treatment of Sexual Offenders (ATSA) Forum</i> Published On: 2018-08-14</p><h2>Mr. Bear Squash-You-All-Flat</h2><p>Mr. Bear, the neighborhood nuisance, roams the forest squashing the houses of other animals until he finally gets his own comeuppance. <br> Afterword by Gary Larson</p><p>Morrell Gipson grew up in South Carolina and now resides in New York City.

But there is a way you can delight in the fragrance and beauty of flowers after dark: Plant a night-blooming garden! Also known as moon gardens, night-blooming gardens are expressly designed for evening enjoyment. While attractive during the day, they take on a whole new look and feel at dusk, casting a magical spell. Pale-colored flowers reflect light from the setting sun and the rising moon, shining luminously and giving the garden an almost mystical glow. Fragrances seem more alluring. Silvery foliage shimmers tremulously as the evening breezes dance by. <br>An aromatic, night-blooming garden offers a peaceful and tranquil spot to rest and relax at the end of the day. It is the perfect place for a casual summer party, an evening reception, a romantic tryst, or a quiet retreat to reflect and rejuvenate the senses.</p><p><p>Author of&nbsp;<em>Planning Planting a Moon Garden</em> and <em>10 Easy-Care Perennials.</em></p></p><h2>The Take (Simon Riske, 1)</h2><p><br><b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Christopher Reich, an international spy thriller featuring Simon Riske: one part James Bond, one part Jack Reacher</b><b><br></b>Riske is a freelance industrial spy who, despite his job title, lives a mostly quiet life above his auto garage in central London. He is hired to perform the odd job for a bank, an insurance company, or the British Secret Service, when he isn't expertly stealing a million-dollar watch off the wrist of a crooked Russian oligarch.<br>Riske has maintained his quiet life by avoiding big, messy jobs; until now. A gangster by the name of Tino Coluzzi has orchestrated the greatest street heist in the history of Paris: a visiting Saudi prince had his pockets lightened of millions in cash, and something else. Hidden within a stolen briefcase is a secret letter that could upend the balance of power in the Western world. The Russians have already killed in an attempt to get it back by the time the CIA comes knocking at Simon's door.<br>Coluzzi was once Riske's brother-in-arms, but their criminal alliance ended with Riske in prison, having narrowly avoided a hit Coluzzi ordered. Now, years later, it is thief against thief, and hot on their trail are a dangerous Parisian cop, a murderous Russian femme fatale, her equally unhinged boss, and perhaps the CIA itself.<br>In the grand tradition of <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> and <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, Christopher Reich's <i>The Take</i> is a stylish, breathtaking ride.</p><p><b>Christopher Reich</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Numbered Account</i>, <i>Rules of Deception</i>, <i>Rules of Vengeance</i>, <i>Rules of Betrayal,</i> <i>The Devil's Banker</i>, and many other thrillers.

One day I will work alongside her in the kitchen. She will teach me what she knows and I will serve a master and mistress. I do not know what else there is for me.</p><p>Abbey is my mistress&#x2019;s cook. Mistress never worries to come to us here. All the time she says she is glad the kitchen is in the kitchen yard away from the house, where it is supposed to be. She does not like the heat or the cooking smells. But I do. I like them most fine.</p><p>Abbey is as close to me as a mother, but she is not my mother. My mother is Jane Mae. I never knew my father, but Abbey knows. Abbey says she knows every hair on my head. She was my mother&#x2019;s dearest friend. She was the midwife who brought me into this world. She nursed me back to my health once when I fell so sick. Mistress said the sickness was Shock that came from the suddenness of losing my beloved mother, Jane Mae. Shock sickness is a deep, dark sadness that covers you. Even when the Shock has passed, it never leaves, like the smell from Sir&#x2019;s tobacco smoke.</p><p>I love Abbey mightily, for she tells me the things I need to know to keep me safe. This night, before we slept, I asked her, &#x201c;Why am I all the time so full up with thoughts and words in my head?&#x201d;</p><p>She did what she always does when she tells me something I need to know. She smiled and patted me. &#x201c;You got reasons so many talking words in there.&#x201d; Then she tapped my head. Tap, tap, tap. &#x201c;Your mama filled your head up with stories. And Mistress petted you and taught you to read and to write.&#x201d; Then she said, &#x201c;Eliza, you are a child who is all filled up with words.&#x201d; I love when Abbey tells me these things. My arms are not long enough to wrap around Abbey&#x2019;s waist like I did with my mother. I wrap my arms tight around Abbey as far as they can go.</p><p>Then Abbey told me, &#x201c;You are not like me, Eliza.&#x201d; First this made me sad. She is all I have now. But my sadness did not linger for long. I became the happiest I can be!</p><p>&#x201c;Talk your words in this,&#x201d; she told me. That&#x2019;s when Abbey gave me Mistress&#x2019;s never-been-used writing diary. Mistress had thrown it out. She cannot see so well to write anymore. I am writing in it now. Abbey gave me two lead pencils, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Write your words in it. But do not ever let Sir see you do it,&#x201d; she warned me. I know what she means. It is unlawful for Slaves to read and write. Mistress does not but Sir enforces the Slave Laws to the letter. Sometimes I am so full of fear for writing in my little book. But I must write. It helps me to think and remember.</p><p><b><b><i>Sunday, February 12, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b></p><p>All day long I worked beside Abbey cleaning out the kitchen garden. Soon the ground will be warm enough to turn over. When we stopped I asked Abbey, &#x201c;Tell me your favorite story.&#x201d; But Abbey said, &#x201c;I cannot tell the stories the way your mother, Jane Mae, did. I never did learn them good enough to tell. I just know them good enough to know.&#x201d; When my mother, Jane Mae, was here, there was always a story to listen to. Back then, Abbey said, &#x201c;Jane Mae told the stories right, from the old way.&#x201d; Then Abbey did not speak for a long time. Finally she said to me, &#x201c;Eliza, you should tell the stories now . . . you your mother&#x2019;s daughter. Look at the picture pattern on your quilt, and remember how each one goes.&#x201d; And Abbey said something that made a smile come up. &#x201c;You already got them inside you.&#x201d; She poked my chest and tapped my head the same way my mother, Jane Mae, did. &#x201c;Remembering in your head and feeling in your heart tells you you always is loved, Eliza.&#x201d;</p><p><b><b><i>Wednesday, February 15, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b></p><p>This day brought too many chores. I did all my usual ones. The work was hard but I have strong hands. Every day I carry the firewood to the kitchen. I fetch hot water to fill two tubs for Sir and Mistress to bathe in; I fill a third for them to rinse off in. I do not spill a drop. I broom-sweep the floors. I peel potatoes and empty the rinds. I scour the pots. Then today Mistress said, &#x201c;Now, Eliza, you must wait on me since Caroline and Abbey cannot.&#x201d; Sir said Abbey and Caroline must help prepare the seed beds for the tobacco. Poor Abbey, she cannot stomach the bad smell from the tobacco, whether it is seedlings or the full-grown plants.</p><p>I had to serve Mistress&#x2019;s morning, afternoon, and evening meals in her room. Mistress is not the same, either, since we lost my mother. She was not always so friendly, and now she is much more sickly and more frail. Mistress is beginning to look like one of those long-necked white egret birds with yellow eyes that live at the river. Abbey says Mistress has always been sickly, and sickest in the winter months. Now that things will be warming soon, Abbey says her strength will come all the way back. I hope so; this sickness in her body is causing Mistress&#x2019;s eyes to go blind. Abbey says she reckons there is a whole lot in the world Mistress just don&#x2019;t want to see. I try to understand Abbey, but sometimes what she says is puzzlement to me. Still, Abbey said she would teach me to gather the herb from the forest and prepare the all-heal remedy. But I already know this. I want to tell Abbey I know where to find the best all-heal. Mama always said it is best for Mistress&#x2019;s ailments where it is wild in the deep woods. All my life my mother would take me to the woods with her to gather it. She taught me about plants and these things and what to do if I am ever lost in the woods. I will wait until Abbey&#x2019;s mind is eased from working with tobacco to remind her of this.</p><p><b><b><i>Monday, February 20, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b></p><p>This morning Sir said Abbey must do more tobacco. This makes her very vexed on Sir. She never wants to be around tobacco. When Abbey is most vexed on Sir, she speaks her mind to me. Today she said there is something I must know and always remember. I write it here so I will never forget. &#x201c;The Slave has to be two of they selves. One self belongs to Mistress and Sir. The other one belongs to you, Eliza.&#x201d; Then she tapped my chest. &#x201c;Keep that one hid. Do not ever let Sir see that one. Do not <i>ever let Sir know that Eliza is even alive.&#x201d; Abbey told me this so I can stay safe. Some of us are beaten, sold, or more&#x2014;much worse, than those who do not do this. And now, for the first time, my eyes are all the way open. I can see for myself what this is meaning.</i></p><p>This day Caroline&#x2019;s oldest boy, Abel, was sold away. I have heard Sir say all the time to Mistress, &#x201c;That boy do not know his place.&#x201d; Early this morning Caroline came to Sir crying. She begged Sir, &#x201c;Oh, Master, please do not take my boy from me!&#x201d; When Sir turned a deaf ear to her, she ran after the wagon. But before she could catch it, Mr. Forrnistock, the overseer, caught up to her on his horse. He landed three heavy blows across her shoulders with his piece of rawhide strap. She dropped to her knees crying. Then they dragged her off to her cabin. No telling how long she will be down from the Shock sick.</p><p>This filled me up with such fear. What will Sir think of me one day? I said this to Abbey. But Abbey said the mistress would protect me. My head wonders why Mistress would save me and not my beloved mother, Jane Mae? I know Abbey did all she could.</p><p><b><b><i>Tuesday, February 21, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b></p><p>Today my head is full of remembering. Caroline&#x2019;s Shock sickness made me remember my own. But Abbey says the past must stay the past. I try but the remembering keeps coming to the front of my mind. I think of that day Sir sold my mother away from here. Abbey said that was a mean trick Sir played on me.</p><p>Early that morning Sir had called for me. &#x201c;Eliza, you go on to town with Ezekiel.&#x201d; <i>Me?</i> I thought. Sir had never sent me to town with Ezekiel to get supplies before, even though I always wanted to go. Ezekiel always goes to town for Sir. He cares for the horses and carriages, too. At first I thought maybe Sir was turning nice, but there was no smile in his voice and his hard face looked about the same.</p><p>The sun was high and pretty in that bright blue sky. The way we go to town, we must pass the whitewash building. &#x201c;That is the Slave pen,&#x201d; Ezekiel said of the place where slaves come to wait to be sold. Ezekiel knows all about it. He talked and talked of it but I hummed so I did not have to hear.</p><p>When we came back from town, I carried a peppermint sweet in the hem of my skirt so it would not melt all the way from Mr. Riley&#x2019;s store. Mrs. Riley had gave two to me. I ate one; the other peppermint was to be a present to my mother. Sir disallows us to have pockets.</p><p>I ran from the wagon to the kitchen before Ezekiel had time to unload. I wanted to see my mother&#x2019;s face full of love. But I did not see her face at all. She was not in the kitchen yard. She was not in the kitchen. She was not tending Mistress. She was not where she was supposed to be with Abbey. It was just a mournful Abbey in the kitchen, stirring tears into Sir&#x2019;s stew. My mother was nowhere that I could find her. Then Abbey told me what had happened. &#x201c;Jane Mae is gone. Sir sold her off.&#x201d; I know Sir probably sent her to the whitewash pen that Ezekiel showed me. I started to run there, but Ezekiel caught me. That&#x2019;s all I remember, before I fell down sick.</p><p>That day, Abbey said Sir is not for truth. He speaks lies. He separates us and sells us away when he says he will not. Abbey said Sir is the worst of a master. Abbey <i>tried to soothe me with her words. But it is not words that I wanted. It was my mother.

All aspects of baseball&#x2014;hitting, pitching, and baserunning&#x2014;are affected by the Code, a set of unwritten rules that governs the Major League game. Some of these rules are openly discussed (don&#x2019;t steal a base with a big lead late in the game), while others are known only to a minority of players (don&#x2019;t cross between the catcher and the pitcher on the way to the batter&#x2019;s box). In <i>The Baseball Codes</i>, old-timers and all-time greats share their insights into the game&#x2019;s most hallowed&#x2014;and least known&#x2014;traditions. For the learned and the casual baseball fan alike, the result is illuminating and thoroughly entertaining. <br> &nbsp;<br> At the heart of this book are incredible and often hilarious stories involving national heroes (like Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays) and notorious headhunters (like Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale) in a century-long series of confrontations over respect, honor, and the soul of the game.

Willie Mays was being shown up in front of a national baseball audience. <br>&nbsp;<br>Under ordinary circumstances there is no acceptable reason for a player to embarrass one of his colleagues on the field. It&#x2019;s the concept at the core of the unwritten rules, helping dictate when it is and isn&#x2019;t appropriate to steal a base, how one should act in the batter&#x2019;s box after hitting a home run, and what a player should or shouldn&#x2019;t say to the media. Nobody likes to be shown up, and baseball&#x2019;s Code identifies the notion in virtually all its permutations. Mantle&#x2019;s display should never have happened, and Mays knew it. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mantle had been joyous for a number of reasons. There was the strikeout itself, which was impressive because to that point Mays had hit Ford like he was playing slow-pitch softball&#x2014;6-for-6 lifetime, with two homers, a triple, and an astounding 2.167 slugging percentage, all in All- Star competition. Also, Ford and Mantle had spent the previous night painting the town in San Francisco in their own inimitable way, and Ford, still feeling the effects of overindulgence, was hoping simply to survive the confrontation. Realizing that he had no idea how to approach a Mays at-bat, the left-hander opened with a curveball; Mays responded by pummeling the pitch well over four hundred feet, just foul. Ford, bleary and already half beaten, didn&#x2019;t see a downside to more of the same, and went back to the curve. This time Mays hit it nearly five hundred feet, but again foul. It became clear to the pitcher that he couldn&#x2019;t win this battle straight up&#x2014;so he dipped into his bag of tricks. <br>&nbsp;<br>Though Ford has admitted to doctoring baseballs in later years, at that point in his career he wasn&#x2019;t well practiced in the art. Still, he was ahead in the count, it was an exhibition game, and Mays was entitled to at least one more pitch. Without much to lose, Ford spat on his throwing hand, then pretended to wipe it off on his shirt. When he released the ball, it slid rotation-free from between his fingers and sailed directly at Mays&#x2019;s head, before dropping, said Ford, &#x201c;from his chin to his knees&#x201d; through the strike zone. Mays could do nothing but gape and wait for umpire Stan Landes to shoot up his right hand and call strike three. <br>&nbsp;<br>To this point in the story, nobody has been shown up at all. Ford may have violated baseball&#x2019;s actual rules by loading up a spitter, but cheating is fairly well tolerated within the Code. Mays&#x2019;s reaction to the extreme break of the pitch may have made him look bad, but that was hardly Ford&#x2019;s fault. But then came Mantle, jumping and clapping like a kid who&#x2019;d just been handed tickets to the circus. It didn&#x2019;t much matter that the spectacle was directed not at Mays but at Giants owner Horace Stoneham, who immediately understood the motivation behind Mantle&#x2019;s antics. <br>&nbsp;<br>Stoneham had gone out of his way to make Mantle and Ford feel at home upon their arrival in town a day earlier, using his connections at the exclusive Olympic Club to arrange a round of golf for the duo, and went so far as to enlist his son Peter as their chauffeur. Because the pair of Yankees had failed to bring golf equipment, their first stop was the pro shop, for shoes, gloves, sweaters, and rental clubs. The total came to four hundred dollars, but the club didn&#x2019;t accept cash. Instead, they charged everything to Stoneham, intending to pay him back at the ballpark the following day. <br>&nbsp;<br>That night, however, the three met at a party at the chic Mark Hopkins Hotel. Ford attempted to settle his tab on the spot, but Stoneham&#x2019;s response wasn&#x2019;t quite what he anticipated: The owner told him to keep his money . . . for the moment. Stoneham then proposed a wager: If Ford retired Mays the first time they faced each other the following afternoon, he owed nothing. Should the center fielder hit safely, however, Ford and Mantle would owe Stoneham eight hundred dollars, double their original debt. Ordinarily, this sort of bet would be weighted heavily in favor of the pitcher, since even the best hitters connect only three times out of ten, but Ford was aware of his track record against Mays. Nonetheless, the lefty loved a challenge even more than he loved a drink, and quickly accepted Stoneham&#x2019;s terms. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mantle, however, wasn&#x2019;t so cavalier, telling Ford frankly just how bad a deal it was. &#x201c;I hated to lose a sucker bet,&#x201d; he said later, &#x201c;and this was one of them.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That didn&#x2019;t keep Ford from sweet-talking him into accepting Stoneham&#x2019;s terms. In center field the next day, Mantle found himself significantly more concerned about the potential four-hundred-dollar hole in his pocket than he was about the baseball ramifications of the Ford-Mays showdown. So, when the Giants&#x2019; star was called out on the decisive spitter, it was all Mantle could do to keep from pirouetting across the field. Said Ford, &#x201c;Here it was only the end of the first inning in the All-Star Game, and he was going crazy all the way into the dugout.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t dawn on me right away how it must have looked to Willie and the crowd,&#x201d; said Mantle. &#x201c;It looked as if I was all tickled about Mays striking out because of the big rivalry [over who was the game&#x2019;s pre-eminent center fielder], and in the dugout when Whitey mentioned my reaction I slapped my forehead and sputtered, &#x2018;Aw, no . . . I didn&#x2019;t . . . how could I . . . what a dumb thing.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That Mantle got away with it was largely due to the fact that Ford later explained the entire affair to Mays, much to May&#x2019;s amusement. In this regard, Mantle was luckier than most players, who usually learn of their indiscretions from well-placed fastballs, not from conversation. For example, stepping out of the batter&#x2019;s box once a pitcher comes set isn&#x2019;t something that inspires retribution in most pitchers, but it did for Goose Gossage&#x2014;in a spring-training game, no less. And Randy Johnson drilled a player in a B-squad game for swinging too hard. New York Mets closer Billy Wagner considered hitting a spring-scrimmage opponent from the University of Michigan who had the nerve to bunt on him. (&#x201c;Play to win against Villanova,&#x201d; the pitcher said afterward.) Nolan Ryan felt similarly when major-leaguers laid down bunts against him, and Don Drysdale and Bob Gibson were likely to knock down any opponent who dug in. All these pitchers felt justified in meting out justice for infractions that the majority of their colleagues barely noticed. <br>&nbsp;<br>Several code violations, however, are universally abhorred. At or near the top of any pitcher&#x2019;s peeves is the home-run pimp, a hitter who lingers in the batter&#x2019;s box as the ball soars over the wall. The first great player to fit this bill was Minnesota&#x2019;s Hall of Fame slugger Harmon Killebrew, by nature a quiet man who happened to take delight throughout the 1960s in watching his big flies leave the yard. &#x201c;Killebrew was the first one I saw (do it),&#x201d; said Frank Robinson. &#x201c;He would stand there and watch them. But heck, he hit the ball so high, he <i>could </i>watch them.&#x201d; Reggie Jackson, widely credited with bringing the practice to prominence in the 1970s, credits Killebrew with providing inspiration. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jackson, of course, added panache and self-absorption to the act, combined with a thirst for attention that Killebrew never knew. During Jackson&#x2019;s days with the Yankees, he went so far as to claim the final slot in batting practice because it afforded him the largest audience before which to perform. This became known as &#x201c;Reggie Time,&#x201d; and the slugger saw fit to bestow it upon some lucky teammate if he was unable to take that slot on a particular day. <br>&nbsp;<br>Barry Bonds eventually became the torchbearer for home-run pimping, not only watching but twirling in the batter&#x2019;s box as a matter of follow-through. David Halberstam wrote of Bonds&#x2019;s mid-career antics for ESPN.com: &#x201c;The pause at this moment, as we have all come to learn, is very long, plenty of time for the invisible but zen-like moment of appreciation when Barry Bonds psychically high-fives Barry Bonds and reassures him once again that there&#x2019;s no one quite like him in baseball.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Admiring one&#x2019;s own longball isn&#x2019;t all that sets pitchers off. When Phillies rookie Jimmy Rollins flipped his bat after hitting a home run off St. Louis reliever Steve Kline in 2001, the Cardinals pitcher went ballistic, screaming as he followed Rollins around the bases. &#x201c;I called him every name in the book, tried to get him to fight,&#x201d; said Kline. The pitcher stopped only upon reaching Philadelphia third baseman Scott Rolen, who was moving into the on-deck circle and alleviated the situation by assuring him that members of the Phillies would take care of it internally. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s f**king Little League s**t,&#x201d; said Kline after the game. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to flip the bat, I&#x2019;m going to flip your helmet next time. You&#x2019;re a rookie, you respect this game for a while. . . . There&#x2019;s a code. He should know better than that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Anxiety Happens: 52 Ways to Find Peace of Mind</h2><p><p><b>Break free from anxiety&#x2014;once and for all!

And he said so. It wasn't only because of his belief in his teammates, led by the master of the comeback, his friend and quarterback Tom Brady-or the coaching staff run by the legendary Bill Belichick. It was also because he had been counted out in most of his life and career, and he had proved them all wrong.<br><br> Whether it was in Pop Warner football, where his Redwood City, California, team won a national championship; in high school where he went from a 4'10", 95-pound freshman running back to quarterback for an undefeated Woodside High team; or college, where he rewrote records at Kent State as a dual-threat quarterback, Edelman far exceeded everyone's expectations. Everyone's expectations, that is, except his own and those of his father, who took extreme and unorthodox measures to drive Edelman to quiet the doubters with ferocious competitiveness.<br><br> When he was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round, the 5'10" college quarterback was asked to field punts and play wide receiver, though he'd never done either. But gradually, under the tutelage of a demanding coaching staff and countless hours of off-season training with Tom Brady, he became one of the NFL's most dynamic punt returners and top receivers who can deliver in the biggest games.<br><br> <i>Relentless</i> is the story of Edelman's rise, and the continuing dominance of the Patriot dynasty, filled with memories of growing up with a father who was as demanding as any NFL coach, his near-constant fight to keep his intensity and competitiveness in check in high school and college, and his celebrated nine seasons with the Patriots. Julian shares insights into his relationships and rivalries, and his friendships with teammates such as Tom Brady, Wes Welker, Matt Slater, and Randy Moss. Finally, he reveals the story behind "the catch" and life on the inside of a team for the ages.<br><br> Inspiring, honest, and unapologetic, <i>Relentless</i> proves that the heart of a champion can never be measured.</p><p><b>Julian Edelman </b>has been a New England Patriots wide receiver since 2009, playing in three Super Bowls, scoring the game-winning touchdown in Super Bowl XLIX and making one of the most memorable catches in NFL history in Super Bowl LI. Edelman is also one of the most productive punt returners in NFL history. A native of Redwood City, California, Edelman now lives in downtown Boston.<b><br><br>Tom E.

He is the epitome of competitiveness, toughness, and the great things that are possible when someone is determined to achieve their goals."&#x2015;<b><i>Bill Belichick<br></i></b><br><br>"Going from being a seventh-round pick to being a great player is a credit to Julian and really one of the most amazing transformations I've seen in this league. To go from a college quarterback, to a pro receiver, then to a great pro receiver? I don't know how many guys that have done that as well as Julian has....It's a privilege for me to play with someone as special as him. I always think I get much more out of my teammates than they get out of me in terms of the relationship and what it means for me to see them grow and succeed. I'm just so proud of him and everything he has accomplished and will continue to accomplish because I know that he's not done. He's got a lot of work he still wants to do."&#x2015;<b><i>Tom Brady<br></i></b><br><br>"Julian has told me one of the reasons he's had success is the way his parents have always been there for him. Being firm and having expectations, but doing it with love and making him understand the hard work that goes along with becoming successful. If you're privileged to have a parent or a mentor guiding you to have great love and respect, I think it gets you through the hard times and helps motivate you to greater things.

Odds are if a guy is willing to leave you standing alone in front of three hundred of your closest friends and relatives, not to mention <em>both</em> your mothers, he isn't going to sweat the little stuff like returning the gifts and paying the caterer. Which explained why three months after going through that exact experience, Andi Gordon was putting her life savings into a house she'd only seen twice, in a town she'd only visited for seventy-two hours.<br><br>Go big or go home. Andi had decided to do both.<br><br>After signing the final paperwork and picking up the keys, she drove up the hill to the highest point on Blackberry Island and stared at the house she'd just bought. It was known as one of the "Three Sisters." Three beautiful, Queen Anne-style homes built around the turn of the last century. According to the Realtor, the house on the left had been restored perfectly. The ice-cream colors reflected the style and fashion of the year it was built. Even its garden was more traditionally English than casual Pacific Northwest. A girl's bike leaned against the porch, looking modern and out of place.<br><br>The house on the right was also restored, but with less period detail. The slate-gray trim framed stained-glass windows and there was a sculpture of a bird taking flight in the front yard.<br><br>The house in the middle still had a For Sale sign planted in the unkempt grass. While like the others in style and size, the house she'd bought had little else in common with its neighbors. From the roof, with missing shingles, to the peeling paint and broken-out windows, the house was a testament to neglect and indifference. If the building hadn't been historic, it would have been torn down years ago.<br><br>Andi had seen the seller's disclosure&#x2014;listing all the problems with the house. It was pages long, listing every major issue, from an electrical upgrade done twenty years before to lousy and nonfunctioning plumbing. The building inspector Andi had hired to look over the place had given up halfway through and returned her money. Then her agent had tried to show her a lovely condo overlooking the marina.<br><br>Andi had refused. She'd known the second she saw the old place that it was everything she'd been looking for. The house had once been full of promise. Time and circumstance had reduced it to its present condition&#x2014;unloved and abandoned. She didn't need a degree in psychology to understand she saw herself in the house. She understood the pitfalls of believing if she fixed the house, she would also be fixing herself. But knowing and doing, or in this case not doing, weren't the same thing. Her head might be busy pointing out this was a mistake of mammoth proportions, but her heart had already fallen in love.<br><br>Given her recent, very public broken engagement, falling for a house seemed a whole lot safer than falling for a man. After all, if the house abandoned her at the altar, she could simply burn it down.<br><br>Now parked in front of the three-story disaster, she smiled.<br><br>"I'm here," she whispered, offering the promise to both herself and the house. "I'll make you whole again."<br><br>The past three months had been a nightmare of logistics and recriminations. Buying one of the "Three Sisters" had given her something else to think about. Emailing documents for her loan was a lot more fun than explaining to her second cousin that yes, after dating for over ten years, Matt really had left her at the altar. He had actually said their decision to marry had seemed sudden and that he'd needed more time. And yes, he had run off to Las Vegas two weeks later, marrying his receptionist. She refused to think about the conversations she'd had on the subject with her mother.<br><br>But knowing that she would soon be leaving Seattle for Blackberry Island had kept her going. She'd focused on her escape. Then she'd packed up her place in the city and headed north.<br><br>Andi squeezed the keys her real estate agent had handed her, feeling the metal dig into her skin. The pain brought her back to the present, to this moment where there were only possibilities.<br><br>She got out of her car and stared at the broken house. But instead of boarded windows and a sagging porch, she saw what it would be. New. Shiny. A home people would admire. Not a castoff. Because when the house was restored, Andi could call her mother and talk about that. It would be a far better conversation than listening to the woman list everything Andi had messed up in her life. Like not allowing Matt to guide her into changing herself and how she'd foolishly let a good man get away.<br><br>Andi turned to admire the view. On a clear day the water of Puget Sound sparkled. Granted, clear days were relatively rare in this part of the country, but Andi was okay with that. She liked the rain. The gray, drizzly sky, the squish of her boots against the sidewalk. All that gloom made her appreciate the sunny days.<br><br>She turned west, looking out over the sound. The houses had a perfect view. They'd originally been built by sea captains, oriented to watch the ships sail in. In the late 1800s, seafaring had still been important to the area, not yet overtaken by the lure of logging.<br><br>This was right, she thought happily. She belonged here. Or she would belong, with time. If the renovations started to get to her, she would simply look at her view. The dance of the water, the peninsula beyond were far different from the high-rises of downtown Seattle. The city might only be a couple of hours away by car, but it was another planet when compared to the small town that was Blackberry Island.<br><br>"Hello! Are you the one who bought the house?"<br><br>Andi turned and saw a woman walking toward her. She was of average height, with long dark red hair that flowed halfway down her back. She wore jeans and clogs, with an ivory cable-knit sweater that just grazed her hips. Her face was more interesting than pretty, Andi thought as she approached. High cheekbones and large green eyes. Her pale skin was probably a result of both genetics and a complete lack of sun exposure since the previous September.<br><br>"Hi. Yes, I am."<br><br>The woman smiled. "Finally. That poor place. It's been so lonely. Oh, I'm Boston. Boston King." She pointed to the house with the sculpture of the bird on the lawn. "I live there."<br><br>"Andi Gordon."<br><br>They shook hands. Weak sunlight broke through the clouds and highlighted what looked like a dark purple streak in Boston's hair.<br><br>Andi fingered her own dark hair and wondered if she should do something as dramatic. The most she'd ever managed was a trim.<br><br>"Any relation to Zeke King?" Andi asked. "He's the contractor I've been emailing about the house."<br><br>Boston's expression brightened. "My husband. He and his brother own a local firm here on the island. He'd mentioned he'd been in touch with the new owner." She tilted her head. "But he didn't say anything about you, and I'm dying to know the details. Can you spare a few minutes? I just put on a fresh pot of coffee."<br><br>Andi thought about the cleaning supplies in the back of her SUV. With the moving van arriving in the morning, she had plenty to do to get the place ready. But there were only three houses on the small cul-de-sac, and getting to know one of her neighbors seemed just as important.<br><br>"I'd love a cup of coffee," she said.<br><br>Boston led the way across the ragged grass to her own yard, then up the steps to the front door. Andi noticed the boards that made up the porch floor had been painted dark blue, and there were stars and planets scattered around. The front door was dark wood with stained-glass panels.<br><br>The eclectic mix of traditional decor and whimsy continued in the foyer. A Shaker-style bench stood by a coatrack. On the wall was a mirror framed by silver squirrels and birds. The living room to the left had comfortable sofas and chairs, but there was a huge painting of a naked fairy over the fireplace.<br><br>Boston led the way down a narrow hallway, painted bloodred, and into a bright, open kitchen. There were cobalt-blue-painted cabinets, sleek, stainless appliances and a gray-and-blue marble countertop. The smell of coffee mingled with fragrant cinnamon and apples.<br><br>"Have a seat," Boston said, pointing at stools pulled up against the breakfast bar. "I just heated a couple of scones. I have cinnamon apple butter I made last fall."<br><br>Andi thought of the protein bar and cup of coffee that had been her breakfast and heard her stomach growl. "That sounds great. Thanks."<br><br>She took the offered seat. Boston opened the oven and removed a cookie sheet with two large scones on it. The apple butter was in a glass jar. Boston put the scones on a plate and passed one over, then poured coffee.<br><br>"Just black for me," Andi told her.<br><br>"Ah, a true coffee drinker. I have to conceal my caffeine in hazelnut and vanilla."<br><br>She got the flavored creamer from the refrigerator.<br><br>Andi glanced around. There was a big window over the sink and another in the corner eating area. A large pantry took up most of one wall. While she could see the original molding and beadboard by the back door, the rest of the kitchen had been updated.<br><br>"I love your space," Andi said. "I'm not sure my kitchen has seen so much as a coat of paint in the last sixty years."<br><br>Boston collected two knives and handed her one, then cut open her scone and smoothed on apple butter. As she worked, several silver charm bracelets clinked together. "We saw your place at the open house. The kitchen was very 1950s."<br><br>"I don't mind the retro look," Andi admitted. "But nothing works. I have a thing about turning on a faucet and having hot water come out. And I'd like a refrigerator that keeps food cold."<br><br>Boston grinned. "So you're a demanding sort."<br><br>"Apparently."<br><br>"I know Zeke's been drawing up plans. I haven't seen all of them, but he and his brother do beautiful work."<br><br>Andi looked at her kitchen. "Did he update your house?"<br><br>"About six years ago." Boston picked up her coffee. "Where are you moving from?"<br><br>The island was small enough that Andi wasn't surprised Boston assumed she was from somewhere else. "Seattle."<br><br>"Big city, huh? This is going to be a change."<br><br>"I'm ready for a change."<br><br>"Do you have a family?"<br><br>Andi knew she didn't mean parents and siblings. "No."<br><br>Boston's expression registered surprise. "That's a big house."<br><br>"I'm a doctor. A pediatrician. I want to use the main level for my practice and live upstairs."<br><br>Boston's shoulders seemed to tighten. "Oh, that's clever. You'll avoid the hassle of commuting." She glanced out the window over the sink toward Andi's house. "There's plenty of space for parking and I can see how the conversion wouldn't be difficult."<br><br>"The biggest modification will be moving the kitchen upstairs. I was going to have to gut it anyway, though, so it won't add much more to the bill." She reached for her scone. "How long have you lived on the island?"<br><br>"I grew up here," Boston told her. "In this house, actually. I've never lived anywhere else. When Zeke and I started dating, I warned him I came with about three thousand square feet of baggage." Her smile faded a little. "He said he liked that about me."<br><br>Andi chewed the vanilla-flavored scone, enjoying the tart apple and cinnamon spread, then swallowed. "Do you work outside the home?"<br><br>Boston shook her head. "I'm an artist. Mostly textiles, although lately..." Her voice trailed off and something dark entered her eyes. "I sometimes do portraits. I'm responsible for most of the strange things you see around here."<br><br>"I love the porch."<br><br>"Do you? Deanna hates it." Boston wrinkled her nose. "She would never say anything, of course, but I hear her sighing every time she steps on it."<br><br>"Deanna?"<br><br>"Your other neighbor."<br><br>"Her house is beautiful."<br><br>"Isn't it? You should see the inside. I'm sure she'll invite you over. The front rooms are furnished true to the time period. The historical societies love her." Boston glanced out the window again. "She has five daughters. Oh, customers for you." She frowned. "Or is it clients?"<br><br>"Patients."<br><br>Boston nodded. "Right. The girls are very sweet." She shrugged. "And that's the neighborhood. Just the three of us. I'm so happy someone is going to be living in the middle house. It's been empty for years. A vacant house can be sad."<br><br>Although nothing about Boston's tone had changed, Andi felt a shift in the other woman's energy. Even as she told herself she was being what her mother would call "weird beyond what we consider normal," she couldn't shake the feeling that her neighbor wanted her gone.<br><br>She quickly finished the rest of her scone, then smiled. "You've been more than kind. I really appreciate the jolt of caffeine and the snack. But I have so much I have to do."<br><br>"Moving. I've heard it's tough. I can't imagine living anywhere but here. I hope you're happy here on our little street."<br><br>"I'm sure I will be." Andi rose. "It was nice to meet you."<br><br>"You, too," Boston told her, walking her to the front door. "Please stop by if you need anything. That includes a shower. We have a guest bath, you know, in case the water gets turned off."<br><br>"That's very nice of you, but if the water gets turned off, I'm moving to a hotel."<br><br>"I like your style."<br><br>Andi waved and stepped out on the porch. Once the front door closed behind her, she paused for a second, looking at her house from her neighbor's perspective. There were several cracked windows on this side, and part of the siding was hanging down, loose and peeling. The yard was overgrown.<br><br>"Talk about ugly," she murmured, returning to her car.<br><br>Not to worry, she told herself. She'd gone over the plans for the remodeling and would be meeting with Zeke first thing Saturday to finalize their contract. Then work would begin.<br><br>In the meantime, she had to get ready for the movers who would arrive in the morning. She'd identified an upstairs bedroom where she would store the majority of her furniture. While the construction was going on, she would live in two small attic bedrooms. They were ugly, but serviceable. The bigger of the two would serve as a living room and pseudo kitchen. If she couldn't heat it in a toaster oven or microwave, she wasn't going to cook it.<br><br>The tiny attic bathroom had a shower obviously built for those who didn't hit the five-foot mark and fixtures dating back to the 1940s, but everything worked. Zeke had promised to rig up a hot water heater right away.<br><br>She had what she would need to survive the three months of construction. Although she'd told Zeke she wanted everything done by early July, in truth she was planning to launch her practice September first, giving her a nice buffer. She'd seen enough shows on HGTV to know there were often problems and time delays in remodelings.<br><br>Andi collected the supplies from the back of her SUV. She needed to clean the room that she would be using for furniture storage, then tackle the bathroom she'd claimed. After that, she was going to reward herself with a pulled-pork sandwich from Arnie's. Her real estate agent had promised the food was great.<br><br></p><h2>Myron Mixon&#39;s BBQ Rules: The Old-School Guide to Smoking Meat</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and star of Destination America&#x2019;s <i>BBQ Pitmasters</i> Myron Mixon goes back to the basics of backyard pit barbecuing with <i>BBQ Rules</i>, offering readers essential old-school barbecue techniques and 50 classic recipes.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In barbecue, &#x201c;old-school&#x201d; means cooking on a homemade coal-fired masonry pit, where the first step is burning wood to make your own coals, followed by shoveling those coals beneath the meat and smoking that meat until it acquires the distinct flavor only true pit-smoking can infuse.

It often attracts questions.</p><p>&#x201c;People were always saying, &#x2018;Oh you live in that home?&#x2019;&#x201d; said Cranmer, president of Cranmer Consultants. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re from the South Hills, you generally know something about this home.&#x201d;</p><p>He was always curious about the tree. The home&#x2019;s former resident, Walter Wagner Jr., told him about a town legend that George Washington camped there.</p><p>Wagner, 78, of Bristol, Ind., who grew up in the home, said he is uncertain where he heard the tale.</p><p>&#x201c;It just seems to be something that somebody once told me,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Then a woman told Cranmer about the possible murder of a woman and children on his lawn.</p><p>She heard that Indians &#x201c;killed and scalped&#x201d; family members living there during post-Revolutionary War years, before the current home was built. The father, who was away when they died, buried his family in the yard and transplanted the tree at their grave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Cranmer said, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s a pretty interesting story.&#x201d;</p><p>To find out if it were true, he searched the Internet and the National Archives, reading war department documents. He came across a letter from Isaac Craig, the commander of Fort Pitt, to Secretary of War Henry Knox, dated March 31, 1792, during the Northwest Indian War. The letter referenced the wife of Deliverance Brown, killed with her three children.</p><p>&#x201c;(The Indians) wanted to terrorize these people from trying to settle out here,&#x201d; said Cranmer, a history buff. &#x201c;Come 1791&#x2013;92, this was a very dangerous place to be. I&#x2019;m told this story and then I read this. How unique that in the same time period I find a record of three children and their mother being killed by the Indians.&#x201d; Yet he wanted physical evidence.</p><p>While watching The History Channel&#x2019;s &#x201c;Unearthing America,&#x201d; he learned about a technique: holding two copper rods steady while walking above a grave will cause the wires to cross, he said.</p><p>Cranmer tried it on the grave of Pete, the family&#x2019;s cocker spaniel.</p><p>&#x201c;It responded,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So with that, I took it out to the front yard and sure enough, when I got near the tree, these things just started going crazy. It&#x2019;s almost like it&#x2019;s mechanical.&#x201d;</p><p>He hired Ground Penetrating Radar Systems Inc., a company The History Channel used to find a graveyard, to examine his yard. The results showed a man-made, 11-by-6-foot, disturbance at the base of the tree. The company&#x2019;s report said the findings are consistent with &#x201c;an excavated grave site, with what appears to be the remains of objects four to five feet down from the surface.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The images that were depicted would have shown four people buried horizontally,&#x201d; Cranmer said.</p><p>Cranmer&#x2019;s son, Bob Jr., 27, said he was &#x201c;taken back&#x201d; as he watched the radar experts in his childhood yard.</p><p>&#x201c;Although, I&#x2019;m not too surprised,&#x201d; he said, because he, too, has heard stories about the property over the years. &#x201c;Older people would be walking down the street and see us on the porch and would come up and share stories with us.&#x201d;</p><p>Cranmer said he has done what he can to determine the history of the tree and burial site. He doesn&#x2019;t want to disturb the grave.</p><p>Instead, this spring he plans to place a brass plaque there.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Nothing in my background prepared me for the supernatural battle I was to fight in the house on Brownsville Road. Before moving there I&#x2019;d had no experience or interest in ghosts. I never saw a ghost when I was a kid and paid little attention to anyone who said they believed in them. The only spooky experience I had was one day, when I was about eleven, my friend dared me to try to go into a supposedly haunted house. It was also on Brownsville Road, down the street a block from the house I eventually bought. It had sat empty for over a decade because it had such a sinister reputation. The big wooden door was painted white, complete with a brass knocker. I went up and knocked on the door tentatively and tried the brass handle a few times, but it was securely locked. I kicked the door as hard as I could, but it was sturdy and my tennis shoes didn&#x2019;t move it an inch. In a last-ditch effort, I turned away and walked back a few feet so I could get a running start. I ran up to try and jump kick it open like they did in the movies. Before I could lift my foot the door swung open on its own, with a menacing creaky sound. I didn&#x2019;t go in to explore. I wasn&#x2019;t that courageous. We were both terrified, looked at each other, and took off as fast as we could run. I later found out that the same evil deeds connected both that house and my own and were, in fact, committed by the same person.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Had I any idea that my childhood ambition of owning the house at 3406 Brownsville Road would eventually devolve into a nightmare, would I have taken my family and left right on the spot? Today I&#x2019;d say yes, but back then I was so full of bravado that I would have bought the house nonetheless.</p><p>Ten years after I had packed up my car and headed off alone for the 101st Airborne Division at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, I was coming home with a wife, four children ages four and under, and a large moving van filled with furniture. I had left the life of a career Army officer to move back to my hometown of Brentwood, a suburb of Pittsburgh. I loved working in Army intelligence and was disappointed to turn my back on a promising career and an assignment to Berlin, but my wife, Lesa, and I had decided it was more important that our kids could ride their bikes to visit their grandparents whenever they liked, so instead I turned in my resignation letter and took a job with AT&amp;T Business Communications in Pittsburgh.</p><p>I would begin my new life by moving into the house I always dreamed of owning.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>As far back as I can remember, I was fascinated with the house on Brownsville Road. There were many great houses on that road, but this one&#x2014;number 3406&#x2014;was special. It held a strange attraction for me, even as a young child. When I was in third grade, some school friends lived on the blue-collar side of Brentwood, and I would pass number 3406 Brownsville Road on a regular basis, going to and from their homes. Every time I passed, I would always pause and stare across the large yard with fascination. What was it like inside? The leaded glass windows, the big white pillars, and the ornate woodwork made it look like a castle. I wanted desperately to go in, to know the rich people who lived there, to sit in the living room!</p><p>I would later be told that there were reasons why I was drawn to this house. I suppose something had to have been at work even back then; why else would I stare at the place for years and imagine that someday I&#x2019;d have a future there? I certainly had no idea I&#x2019;d end up having to fight for it, to battle something so evil that it was beyond my comprehension.</p><p>Even when I bought it, other factors were at work. Through a twist of fate, as we were preparing for the move to Brentwood I learned the house was on the market before it went up for sale. My mother was a retired real estate broker who still had contacts in the business, and she&#x2019;d heard the owners were extremely anxious to sell. We jumped at the chance, and they accepted our first offer without question. It took years before we understood why they did&#x2014;and why they were so anxious to get out.</p><p>But by then it was much too late.</p><p>The McHenrys, the couple who sold it to us, claimed they were selling because Mrs. McHenry worked for the Pittsburgh School District as a nurse and a new policy required that she live in the city, not the suburbs. It did seem strange that they were moving from a house they had put so much work into. I wondered why she just didn&#x2019;t get another job. To be honest, though, I didn&#x2019;t care too much about their reasons, as I was so excited to finally own the house I&#x2019;d longed for most of my life.</p><p>Like the house itself, Brownsville Road had a story to tell. Originally an Indian trail and later a plank-road turnpike, it had a history stretching back to the days of Lewis and Clark as well as the famous Underground Railroad. The road ran south to the National Pike at Brownsville, Pennsylvania. The first telegraph lines to Pittsburgh were strung along Brownsville Road.</p><p>At the time it was built, a few years before World War I, the house was considered to be a &#x201c;country house,&#x201d; located about seven miles out of the city. Originally built by people of means, it was situated well away from the smoke and soot that dominated the river valleys. By the time we moved in, Brownsville Road was no longer an enclave of wealthy business owners. It had seen its share of both prosperity and hard times and weathered the decades in proud fashion, tarnished and faded in places but still fighting to maintain its dignity.</p><p>In a way, I identified with it. I&#x2019;m a fighter, too. Growing up in Brentwood, you had to be. Sometimes you took your lumps, but you were proud to be from the neighborhood. You never ran away from a fight or a challenge.</p><p>The stately appearance of the house rivals any New England shore home or grand Southern plantation. The design was so unique it was designated as a Historic Landmark in 1994 and a front-page article about it appeared in the local section of the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>. Not as large in size as some of the other Pittsburgh turn-of-the-century homes&#x2014;only fourteen rooms on three floors&#x2014;it has an enormous front porch with large majestic white barrel pillars. It has a foyer the size of the average living room and an impressive two-tier oaken staircase that leads up to an open wraparound second-floor balcony. There are three ornate working fireplaces on the second floor and three on the first floor.</p><p>The house was originally built on four lots, but the current owners had sold off a horizontal lot in the back where the carriage house had once stood. A small ranch-style house had been squeezed in, and it looked completely out of place. Alongside the back were the neighbor&#x2019;s encroaching flowers, but closer to the side street and all along the side, the house was surrounded by tall weeds and vines and resembled an urban jungle. It was as if the place were trying to hide.</p><p>When Lesa and I first saw it, its sheer size intimidated us. The wraparound balcony on the second floor looking down into the foyer was something that we had never experienced before. The front porch with the massive pillars was also very overpowering. There was a somewhat seductive, stately feel that drew us in. The house exuded a feeling of history, wealth, and success. It was nothing like the small two-story home I&#x2019;d grown up in, which was comfortable but solidly middle class. This house was a mini-mansion, and it fit my aspirations like a glove. I&#x2019;d always pictured myself living somewhere really grand that matched my personality and ambitions. An amateur historian and budding politician, I always viewed myself as a general or a respected statesman. I imagined the conversations that must have taken place in its spacious rooms: the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, the start of the First World War, and the fall of the stock market. Windup record players had played music during the 1920s, and servants had once prepared and served dinner in an elegant, aristocratic setting. There was still a servant&#x2019;s bell in the kitchen. Minus the servants, I planned to bring it all back.</p><p>To my wife and our four small children, this house with its built-in bookcases, music room, and nine-foot ceilings was truly a castle. We could not control our excitement about living in such a magnificent place.</p><p>My elation was dampened somewhat during the walk-through with the owners. Their behavior was strange, as if they were hiding something. We were down in the basement and Mr. McHenry was explaining the old furnace when Lesa suddenly noticed little Bobby was not with us.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Bobby?&#x201d; she asked, turning around. The basement was partitioned into a series of different rooms, making it difficult to know if the boy was upstairs or hiding just around the corner.</p><p>&#x201c;Bobby?&#x201d; she called, &#x201c;are you down here? Jessica, did you see your brother come downstairs with us?&#x201d;</p><p>Jessica shook her head quickly while hopping from one foot to the other. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it down here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I want to leave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, honey, this will be our home soon,&#x201d; I reassured Jessica and then turned to Lesa. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s fine, Lesa. He&#x2019;s in the house, probably just exploring.&#x201d; Lesa frowned and looked toward the open stairs that led up to the door and into the kitchen. The door was closed. I wondered how that had happened, since I&#x2019;d been the last one down the stairs and I hadn&#x2019;t shut it.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to go look for him?&#x201d; I said. From the corner of my eye, I saw Mr. McHenry glance toward his wife. His face had taken on an expression of concern, and he seemed to be trying to signal Mrs. McHenry from across the room.</p><p>Mrs. McHenry started quickly up the stairs and pushed open the door at the top. Mr. McHenry dropped the worried expression and went back to smiling.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ve seen enough down here,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>As the do...</p></p><h2>How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market: Now Revised &amp; Updated for the 21st Century</h2><p>How did a world-famous dancer with no knowledge of the stock market, or of finance in general, make 2 million dollars in the stock market in 18 months starting with only $10,000?

Sally Weans From Night Nursing encourages the gradual process of weaning without absolutes or judgements regarding when a child &#34;should&#34; wean. This book helps to validate the child&#39;s feelings associated with change and leads mother and child through to a new phase in thier relationship. As a prior mental health therapist, (MSW, LCSW-inactive stay at home mom) I believe that when a child&#39;s feelings are validated and acknowledged, their emotional distress is signifigantly reduced. When a mother is ready, this book can be read to her child several times throughout the day in preparation for night weaning. The characters and circumstances in this book can then be discussed to help comfort and validate a child struggling with weaning. When I used this book to night wean my 18 month old daughter, I would mention the character Sally to remind my daughter that we needed to go back to sleep until the morning &#34;like Sally.&#34; This book can help a child understand that although the end of night nursing may be upsetting, there are also many benefits to getting a good night sleep. As I wrote this book to help my daughter night wean, there is a detailed description of what I did, how I felt, and how I prepared for this event. My daughter was night weaned after 4 nights and then we had a messy strawberry shortcake celebration with homemade whip cream!</p><p>Lesli Mitchell lives in Orange County,CA with her husband Ernie and their daughter Ava. She wrote this book and used it to help her daughter wean from night nursing in a gentle way. Lesli is an stay at home mom and enjoys doing art and writing stories with her daughter. Lesli is an MSW, and in-active LCSW, whom worked for many years as a social worker and therapist with children and families.</p><h2>Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography</h2><p><b>The all-access biography and</b>&nbsp;<b>unprecedented look at the life, career, and legacy of a pint-sized kid from Long Island who became a music legend.</b><br><br>Exhibiting unparalleled intimate knowledge, Schruers chronicles Joel&#x2019;s rise to the top of the charts, from his working-class origins in Levittown and early days spent in boxing rings and sweaty clubs to his monumental success in the seventies and eighties. He also explores Joel&#x2019;s creative transformation in the nineties, his dream performance with Paul McCartney at Shea Stadium in 2008, and beyond.<br><br>Along the way, Schruers reveals the stories behind all the key events and relationships&#x2014;including Joel&#x2019;s high-profile marriages and legal battles&#x2014;that defined his path to stardom and inspired his signature songs, such as &#x201c;Piano Man,&#x201d; &#x201c;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant,&#x201d; &#x201c;New York State of Mind,&#x201d; and &#x201c;She&#x2019;s Always a Woman.&#x201d; Throughout, he captures the spirit of a restless artist determined to break through by sharing, in his deeply personal lyrics, the dreams and heartbreaks of suburban American life.<br><br>Comprehensive, vibrantly written, and filled with Joel&#x2019;s memories and reflections&#x2014;as well as those of the family, friends, and band members who have formed his inner circle, including Christie Brinkley, Alexa Ray Joel, Jon Small, and Steve Cohen&#x2014;this is the definitive account of a beloved rock star&#x2019;s epic American journey.</p><p><b>Fred Schruers</b>&nbsp;enjoyed a successful high-profile career as a writer at <i>Rolling Stone, </i>chronicling an impressive body of musicians and actors, including Fleetwood Mac, Bruce Springsteen, Jack Nicholson, Sheryl Crow, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Chris Rock. His writing has also appeared in <i>Premiere, Entertainment Weekly, Men&#x2019;s Journal, GQ, </i>the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> and <i>Columbia Journalism Review. </i><b>Prologue</b><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s five o&#x2019;clock on a Monday, and the regular crowd shuffles in . . . to the chilly, unpopulated&nbsp; great hall of Madison Square Garden, where a crew is still slapping down chairs on the big slabs of decking that cover the hockey rink.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toting guitars, drumsticks, horns, and earpieces, Billy Joel&#x2019;s band arrays itself for a sound check, and now up a metal staircase comes the man himself. You could say he&#x2019;s shuffling as well; both &nbsp;hips were re- placed in mid-2010, and now, January 27, 2014, he&#x2019;s fully mended&#x2014;but not likely to be doing the backflips off the piano that, he&#x2019;ll occasionally speculate, led to that operation.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he perches on his compact stool, checking settings on the hybrid acoustic/synthesized piano he uses, the band looks up expectantly. He&#x2019;s notoriously bored by sound checks, which means there&#x2019;ll be plenty of japes about his age, certain band peccadillos, or the world situation, all delivered with ready wit. But at the same time, all hands had better be &#x201c;on the one&#x201d; when he delivers a casual instruction, because the message won&#x2019;t come twice.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From time to time, as in an open-air-arena sound check in Perth in December 2008, he&#x2019;ll get a wild hair and lead the band through pretty much an entire classic album. In that case, it was <i>Disraeli Gears </i>by Cream&#x2014;at least until the constables put a stop to it after a volley of noise complaints from the neighborhood.<br> Billy, warmed by a plain black watch&nbsp; ap and a wool sports&nbsp; coat, plinks out a few exploratory notes as the others tune up around him. He gazes about&#x2014;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t hear the room as well I used to hear it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight will be his forty-seventh show at what&#x2019;s pretty much the most storied concert venue in the world. You get here just the way you get to Carnegie Hall&#x2014;&#x201c;Practice&#x201d;&#x2014;but it really helps if you sell tens of millions of albums. In his case the figure is 110 million or so, and that&#x2019;s part of the reason he&#x2019;s playing this inaugural gig to kick off an open- ended &#x201c;residency,&#x201d; a series of monthly Garden dates that will continue, as he said in a recent press conference, &#x201c;as long as there&#x2019;s demand.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A blogger for <i>Forbes</i> computed that, based on rapid sellouts, the strength of the Joel catalog, and what demographers might call his enormous local and worldwide fan base, something approaching forty shows might match that demand.<br> No one&#x2019;s expecting him to do that many, of course, but you never know.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Billy&#x2019;s&nbsp; still eyeballing&nbsp; the&nbsp; arena&#x2019;s&nbsp; distant&nbsp; reaches,&nbsp; somewhat&nbsp; obscured by new carpeted&nbsp; catwalks&nbsp; leading to bunker-like luxury suites. He&#x2019;s wondering why the sound waves seem muted: &#x201c;Either I&#x2019;m going deaf or the room is different. Is there a big sponge up there?&#x201d;&nbsp; He waits a beat, as the band, knowing his timing, remains at parade rest&#x2014;&#x201c;Ah, I guess it&#x2019;s the hair in my ears.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At sixty-four, he&#x2019;s allowed to kvetch a bit. Three hours from now, a few songs into his set, when the packed&nbsp; house has already marched in place to the epic sweep of &#x201c;Miami&nbsp; 2017,&#x201d;&nbsp; bounced&nbsp; in rhythm&nbsp; (the Garden is on massive, pulsating springs) to &#x201c;Pressure,&#x201d; crooned along to the enchanting&nbsp; soliloquy that&nbsp; is &#x201c;Summer,&nbsp; Highland&nbsp; Falls,&#x201d; and ditty- bopped and doo-wopped to &#x201c;The Longest Time,&#x201d; he pauses: &#x201c;Good evening, New York City . . .&#x201d; A roar like a gut punch breaks over the stage. &#x201c;I have no idea how long this is gonna go.&#x201d;<br> The alert eyes,&nbsp; somehow&nbsp; made&nbsp; more&nbsp; magnetic&nbsp; by the&nbsp; bald&nbsp; pate above, swivel around&nbsp; the room as he takes a sip of water. The guys in the crowd give their dates a knowing look- You think it&#x2019;s really water? &#x201c;This year is my fiftieth year in show business.&#x201d; A subtle resettling of his spine&#x2014;as in, we&#x2019;re practicing our trade here. Another beat. &#x201c;What was I thinking?&#x201d;&nbsp; Now he turns to peer at the image of his head and torso, many times life-size. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think I was gonna end up looking like that in 1964.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The big banks of speakers are putting out their crisp, almost subliminal exhalations as the crowd noise modulates down&#x2014;the fans are thinking what fifty years means to Billy, and to them. They&#x2019;re hoping to hear &#x201c;Movin&#x2019; Out&nbsp; (Anthony&#x2019;s Song),&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x201c;New&nbsp; York State&nbsp; of Mind,&#x201d; and &#x201c;River of Dreams,&#x201d; which are all but a certainty,&nbsp; as well as &#x201c;Piano Man,&#x201d;&nbsp; which&nbsp; is a certainty,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; set&nbsp; list sites have hinted&nbsp; they&#x2019;ll be sent out into the night after a four-song encore capped by a tub- thumping,&nbsp; horn-washed&nbsp; take of &#x201c;Only the Good Die Young.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&#x2019;s time enough for the key anthems, and time, too, for some &#x201c;deep cuts&#x201d; like &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the Orchestra?&#x201d; But first Billy&#x2019;s got one more observation about the doo-wop moment: &#x201c;It sounds better in the men&#x2019;s room,&#x201d; as he and his bandmates demonstrated, bouncing &#x201c;The Longest Time&#x201d; off dingy tiles in the song&#x2019;s 1984 video. &#x201c;We used to sneak out at night and sing it on the street corner&#x2014;and people would throw shit at us!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, clearly that was then. And tonight, when he&#x2019;s sixty-four, they still need him, too, to borrow a phrase from a song. Mike DelGuidice, new utility player in the band, centerpiece of his own Joel tribute band called Big Shot, and maybe the number one fan in the room, will sum it up later in the bar where the band gathers.&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just the guy. That is the guy. He&#x2019;s more loved than anyone on the planet, musically.&#x201d; Mike has just come down from the hotel room he hurried to after the gig to take a family phone call. When he sat on the bed and started to think about having just played opening night alongside Billy in the Garden, he &#x201c;wept like a baby for a good five minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Billy&#x2019;s even here in this sacramental spot, soon to be filled with eighteen thousand faithful fans, goes against the steepest of odds. If a harbormaster in Havana hadn&#x2019;t let his father&#x2019;s family disembark to find refuge from the Nazis; if his mom hadn&#x2019;t found that piano teacher; if he hadn&#x2019;t drilled into his own alienation to write his saga as that piano man; and if some label bosses hadn&#x2019;t stuck by him after his first two albums tanked, he might be sitting down to the keys at a very different spot on the map.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&#x2019;s a particular&nbsp; moment in almost every one of his shows when, a song or two in, while listening to that odd sonic tumult of roaring approval, hollered song titles, and proprietary shout-outs of his first name, he leans left and forward on his piano stool and searches the faces of the crowd in his periphery. There&#x2019;s usually a tentative grin, but there&#x2019;s also a jigger of uncertainty&#x2014;and therefore vulnerability&#x2014;that stops short of neediness but is still somehow in touch with it. Tonight it will come be- fore &#x201c;Summer, Highland Falls,&#x201d; with its telling lyric: &#x201c;And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives / With our respective similarities / It&#x2019;s either sadness or euphoria.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On a different day, in a different city, in what his intimates still think of as the bad, sad old days of 2009, he grew reflective on a hotel balcony: &#x201c;Obviously I have plenty of regrets. Whenever I hurt somebody, whether it was inadvertently or rashly, I still regret that to this day. I&#x2019;ve never wanted to ever hurt anybody, and those are regrets I&#x2019;ll take with me to the grave. But I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ve lived unless you have regrets. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ve had that experience without them, where you can say honestly, when you&#x2019;re ready to kick, hey, I lived. Good Lord, man, what a life I&#x2019;ve <i>lived</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to do that. That may take some of the sting out of dying&#x2014;to say, I did it all.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><b>Chapter 3<br>TOMORROW IS TODAY<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b> &nbsp;In the late 1960s, as the British Invasion led to an expanding galaxy of stateside rock groups, Billy and his chronically unnameable band ended up being dropped from Mercury Records but played the Plainview, Long Island, nightclub My House frequently. The Island was as warm with fledgling bands. Billy had often watched My House&#x2019;s resident band, the Hassles, who were relied upon, if hardly coddled, by club owner and sometime restaurateur Danny Mazur.&nbsp; Danny&#x2014;recalled by Billy as &#x201c;a typical Long Island club owner, kind of a tough, older Jewish guy, pinky ring, very heavyset, kind of gruff&#x201d;&#x2014;sometimes kept company with some beefy types Billy surmised were wise guys. Working alongside him&#x2014;and as the Hassles&#x2019; manager&#x2014;was his son Irwin. Though Irwin would later, via Danny&#x2019;s connections, be briefly employed by industry legend Morris &#x201c;Moishe&#x201d; Levy (of whom Irwin freely says, &#x201c;He was Jewish Mafia&#x201d;), at this time he was helping Danny audition and book bands. He had returned to Long Island for that purpose from Philadelphia, where he was studying dentistry at University of Pennsylvania.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hassles were drawing big crowds at the time. &#x201c;We could draw a thousand people a night to a place,&#x201d; recalls drummer Jon Small, already a cover-band veteran when he formed the group. &#x201c;We were very, very popular.&#x201d; They had a keyboard player named Harry Weber, and Small was married to Harry&#x2019;s sister Elizabeth and had a son by her, Sean, born in April 1967. Billy would never know Harry well&#x2014;he recalls the infamously dissolute musician had a &#x201c;lot of issues&#x201d;&#x2014;but of course he would come to know Elizabeth very well indeed.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally one night Harry and Jon had a serious set-to triggered by Harry&#x2019;s&nbsp; deepening&nbsp; immersion&nbsp; in&nbsp; glue-sniffing,&nbsp; even&nbsp; onstage,&nbsp; where he&#x2019;d&nbsp; catch&nbsp; half-hidden&nbsp; snorts&nbsp; from a poly bag while crouched&nbsp; on the low bench behind his keyboard. Harry finally exploded backstage after being rebuked one last time. As Small describes it: &#x201c;He had his feet on my shoulders and was pulling my hair out. What it came down to was either him leaving or me leaving. And the other guys stuck with me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry, as part of a gaggle of Weber siblings who were raised in tony Syosset but lived a cursed history that most would associate with a less privileged lifestyle, would not land happily. A few years after being discharged from the band, he was found dead on a railroad track, the re- ported victim of an overdose.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what Small smilingly calls &#x201c;a very crafty&#x201d;&nbsp; maneuver,&nbsp; he put an ad in the local paper in the spring of 1966 saying My House was seeking a second&nbsp; house&nbsp; band.&nbsp; &#x201c;What they&#x201d;&#x2014;the Echoes,&nbsp; the&nbsp; key auditioning band that&nbsp; included Billy&#x2014;&#x201c;didn&#x2019;t know was that&nbsp; I was sitting there&nbsp; looking to steal their keyboard&nbsp; player.&#x201d; As Small sat in the otherwise empty club with Elizabeth,&nbsp; Hassles guitarist&nbsp; Richie McKenna, lead singer &#x201c;Little John&#x201d; Dizek, and Irwin, the Echoes&#x2014;with Billy on Farfisa organ&#x2014;performed a few songs. Small remembers, &#x201c;I instantly loved this keyboard player. He wore a little bebop hat, and he actually got down on one knee and sang &#x2018;Soul and Inspiration,&#x2019; the Righteous Brothers song.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So I convinced the other guys that this is the guy, and I went to Billy and sat him in the room and said, &#x2018;The reason you&#x2019;re here is&#x2014; how would you like to join the Hassles?&#x2019; And he looked at me and said, &#x2018;Nope, not interested.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So I had to use another tactic. I knew these guys&#x2014;nobody had any money. I had to bribe him is what it really came down to. I said, &#x2018;So what is it going to take for you to get in the band?&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;Look, I&#x2019;m loyal to my band, I&#x2019;ve been with these guys, grew up with these guys.&#x2019; I said,<br> &#x2018;Well, I have a Hammond B3 organ.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s what everybody wanted.<br> &#x2018;You join the band, it&#x2019;s yours.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t take more than a glimmer in his eye to think about it, and he said, &#x2018;Okay, I&#x2019;ll come in the band. But you have to take the bass player from my band, Howie Blauvelt.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy didn&#x2019;t want to be responsible, as Weber had been, for playing the bass line on the Hammond&#x2019;s bass pedals. &#x201c;The Hassles were only a four-piece band,&#x201d; says small. &#x201c;But I thought, Okay, why not? We&#x2019;ll just branch out; we&#x2019;ll be a five-piece band. So Billy and Howie joined.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hassles offered Billy $250 a week, which in 1967&#x2014;when the minimum hourly wage was a little more than two dollars&#x2014;was good money, especially given the added benefit of being drafted into a top local band. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re working fifty-two weeks a year if you want,&#x201d; Mazur added to Jon Small&#x2019;s pitch, &#x201c;guaranteed.&#x201d; For someone who had worked in an inking factory blacking typewriter ribbons; and had worked winter mornings on the wet, greasy deck of an oyster dredge; and had even written a few rock reviews for Changes magazine for the twenty-five- dollar fee they earned him, it all sounded quite satisfactory.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody was worried about having a real job then,&#x201d; recalls Billy. &#x201c;I was happy just to be a musician with enough money to buy some food and have my own place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for that Hammond B3 Jon said they&#x2019;d give Billy?

Billy didn&#x2019;t even have a wallet. He was this funny guy. You could tell he was very smart, but the thing young guys craved were to have their first car&#x2014;but he had no craving to have one.

Until now, that river has been blocked, barricaded, and diverted by the primitive lower brain. The lower brain hijacks our ability to experience deeper flow and higher transcendent states of consciousness. It also guards against the full expression of the passionate human heart. Source Code Meditation (SCM), with its nine summits of transformation, effortlessly re-routes that lower brain diversion, allowing you to activate latent energy in your body, awaken your higher brain, enlighten your mind, and set your heart on fire to create a new world. <br><br>With traditional meditation techniques, it often takes decades of practice for hours each day to confer significant changes in the mind and the higher brain. Few of us make it to these rarified states of mind, due to the amount of time and the intensity of focus needed. With &#x201c;brain first&#x201d; SCM techniques, you mobilize latent energy in the body and direct it to energize and awaken the higher brain before meditation begins. With the higher brain prepped and tuned, meditation is efficiently received, leading to quantum breakthroughs in higher consciousness without years of practice as well as access to deep flow states, transcendent states of consciousness, and higher brain potential. <br><br>Providing a simplified step-by-step guided process to SCM, Dr. Michael Cotton explains how to shift energy out of the lower &#x201c;survive&#x201d; brain into the higher &#x201c;thrive&#x201d; brain to bring confidence, clarity, and empowerment for transformative change in all areas of life. Distilled from the world&#x2019;s most comprehensive philosophy, Integral Metatheory, SCM offers not only a way to create the brain state necessary to change the mind, but the crystal clarity needed to use these advanced meditative states to actualize your potential and live your destiny to the fullest.</p><p>Dr. Michael Cotton, D.C., is a leading theorist in the evolution of consciousness, culture, and the brain. The creator of the Higher Brain Living technique with more than 30 years&#x2019; experience in personal and cultural transformation, he holds a doctorate in Chiropractic. He lives in Chicago, Illinois.Chapter 1 <br><br><b>The Source Code Mediation Base</b> <br><br>Merging into subtle energy vortexes of the body and mobilizing subtle energy to the higher brain leads to automatic activated breath/prana flowing through the body as feedback, further awakening your higher brain. This feedback creates a prolonged shift into thrive physiology that can immediately be followed by meditation. <br><br>Due to the brain FIRST nature of SCM, and the harnessing of the power of the awakened brain, the amount of meditation required to produce profound effects is proportionally much less than with traditional meditation techniques. You will practice forming the meditation base for 2 weeks before introducing the meditation. Don&#x2019;t underestimate the power of creating the meditation base alone. Profound stress dissipation, physical healings and dramatic awakenings in brain/mind can occur before you ever leverage this awakened brain response with meditation. After 2 weeks of practice you should not only be proficient at turning on the higher brain response (forming the meditation base) but also have started noticing changes in how you feel; less stress, more clarity etc. <br><br>I want you to experience SCM early in this book so that you can begin releasing stress, awakening your higher brain and accessing deeper states of consciousness. We are going to get started with the Source Code Meditation soon. The &#x201c;why&#x201d; behind the various components of the SCM technique will be articulated later but I did not want detailed explanation regarding the theory and mechanisms of SCM to hold you up from learning to shift your brain/mind right now. The &#x201c;why&#x201d; we do want we do will be articulated as we go, however I want to begin the &#x201c;how&#x201d; now. <br><br>You will begin by learning to activate two key contact points that are &#x201c;subtle energy vortex&#x2019;s (SEV),&#x201d; in your body, an upper subtle energy vortex contact point at the top of the spine (base of the skull area) and a lower SEV contact point at the bottom of the spine (sacrum/coccyx area). As I will discuss in detail later, these two contact points have been known for millennia as key entryways into the subtle energy system of the human body. You will use your touch, breath, and intention to <i>merge</i> into these SEV contact points and awaken dormant energy that will flow to your higher brain and activate an automated feedback response of breath/prana tuning your brain to receive advanced meditation! <br><br>The act of &#x201c;merging&#x201d; into the upper and lower SEV contact points is the key to mastering the Source Code Meditation Base (the higher brain state precursor to the actual meditation). What I call <i>merging</i> occurs as touch, breath and intention all converge on the contact point and enter into the SEV in a very specific way. When this merge into the SEV is experienced it feels as though your touch, breath and intention have become one with the SEV. In other words, as you enter the SEV there is a precise moment that occurs in which you can not tell where your physical touch ends and the vortex within your body begins. This merging or suspending sensation leads to the inability to feel the specific localized point that you are merging into, there is a sense of infinity rather than a localized point in space-time. The merge feels multidimensional and experienced outside of usual space-time boundaries. The subtle energy that will travel to your higher brain mobilizes out of this state. As your touch, breath and intention enter the SEV and create the merge, a release of subtle energy traverses through pathways to your higher brain. <br><br>The proper and consistent ability to create this merge and thus mobilize subtle energy to you brain, will take some practice to master. The time and energy invested into becoming proficient at establishing the Source Code Meditation Base is an investment into the &#x2018;base&#x2019; of your new enlightened life. <br><br>According to the science of dynamical systems, small positive fluctuations in a chaotic system in the right place and at the right time can catalyze the entire system moving to higher order. Through the mobilization of this subtle energy a &#x201c;pattern interrupt&#x201d; occurs in the human body/mind as this subtle energy moves to your higher brain and creates a feedback mechanism of activated breath/prana flowing through you and facilitating your emergence to a &#x201c;higher order.&#x201d; This &#x201c;pattern interrupt&#x201d; provides an opening that will be leveraged through SCM and the 9 Summits of Transformation to create new higher levels of organization in body, mind and spirit. <br><br>The active breath/prana may feel subtle in you at first, a slight change in breathing, twitching sensations or a mild current of energy, trust the process... bigger is not better. As you become proficient merging into your own subtle energy vortexes you will feel this active breath/prana flowing in you to your higher brain. When active breath/prana fully engages it can feel like something is breathing you... new breath patterns and energy flows arise spontaneously. This experience of automated breathing and waves of energy can be stopped by you by merely changing position and willing it to stop. However the freeing and liberating experience, even if unusual and without past reference, feels natural, deeply rejuvenating and like you have found home. In subsequent chapters you will learn a lot more about these emergent responses and feedback mechanisms, including our research on the impact on higher brain functioning studied at the Source Code Meditation World Headquarters in Chicago, IL. <br><br>As you perform and practice this sacred work you are going to witness miracles that are new to you. You will feel as though what you are doing is magic. I assure you it is not. Do not let this go to your head. You are a vehicle, a conduit for a power that is bigger than you, or me, or any of us. You are setting loose the impulse that contains the power and wisdom of life itself. This process deserves reverence. We are on hallowed ground. Lets learn the process now...</p><h2>Garden to Glass: Grow Your Drinks from the Ground Up</h2><p><p><b>You&#x2019;ve heard of farm to table; now learn how to grow your drinking game from the ground up in<i>Garden to Glass</i>!</b></p> <p><i>Garden to Glass: Grow Your Drinks From the Ground Up</i>, written by expert mixologist, Mike Wolf focuses on the movement and philosophy illustrating how to incorporate the natural world into the drinks we love to make, drink, and share with friends. This book offers readers simple gardening tips and instructions on how to use those plants to make dynamic cocktails and delicious cordials and elixirs. Complete with recipes, striking photography, and detailed illustrations, <i>Garden to Glass</i> is as valuable a resource to bartenders and bar owners as it is to home bar enthusiasts.</p> <p>In Garden to Glass you will find tips and insights on:</p> <ul> <li>Preserving ingredients for winter</li> <li>Cocktail presentation</li> <li>Methods for making syrups, cordials, bitters, and more</li> <li>Foraging for ingredients</li> <li>Utilizing vegetables to make exciting cocktails</li> <li>Resourcing ingredients locally</li> <li>How to use smoke and flame to create flavors</li> <li>How to make the most of your terroir</li> <li>Drink styles from around the world</li> <li>And much more!</li> </ul> <p>We are in the heart of the second golden age of the cocktail in America. Now imbibers of all stripes can take the reins themselves and learn how to grow their own herbs and vegetables, harvest herbs to make their own teas and tinctures, and make cordials, bitters, and elixirs of all kinds, all while learning the basics of making drinks at home.</p> <p>There are cocktail programs in restaurants and bars all over the world that are adapting this local yet worldly approach to cocktails simply by paying more attention to the world around them. Bartenders can now study the micro-climates where their favorite spirits are made, and make use of the botanicals that grow all around them. From the mint in mojitos to the wild botanicals in regional styles of gin, this book will explore the way bartenders, growers and distillers alike are re-shaping the way cocktails are being made, presented and consumed.</p></p><p><p>Mike Wolf opened and established the bar program at Husk in Nashville, Tennessee and spent the next five years developing a hyper-seasonal and dynamic style of cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks, utilizing on-site gardens, the bounty of Middle Tennessee and a home garden where he grew upwards of 30 different varieties of herbs and vegetables all for the purpose of making cocktails and elixirs. His drinks have been featured in <i>Imbibe Magazine, Local Palette Magazine, the Tennessean, Foodable TV Network</i> and more.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Garden to Glass</i> is a back-to-the-land cocktail manifesto. Rather than chase down exotic liqueurs, Mike Wolf finds new flavors in roadside berries, garden-variety leaves and flowers, and even a few weeds. This is an inspired re-imagining of the twenty-first century cocktail, one that takes drinks back to their roots (literally) through the fruits and herbs that anyone can grow. Wolf's enthusiasm and improvisational spirit are refreshing--and after the first chapter, you'll never look at tomato leaves the same way again.&#x201d;&#x2015; Amy Stewart, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Drunken Botanist</i></p> <p>&#x201c;There has always been one word to describe Mike Wolf and that is "thoughtful."

In <i>Love Is the Killer App</i> he explains why. Sander's advice is to be a "lovecat," which despite the cutesy moniker is his sincere and surprisingly practical prescription for advancement both inside and outside the office. It starts with amassing as much usable knowledge as possible, which he explains can be done by religiously carving out time to read and then poring through as many cutting-edge books in your field as possible. It follows with an emphasis on networking to the extreme. Sanders offers concrete suggestions, from compiling a super list of contacts to ensuring all are regularly stored in an always-accessible format. And he concludes by advocating a true mindset of compassion, which he says involves sharing this knowledge with those contacts and ultimately helping anyone who in one way or another may ultimately help you. Through identifiable anecdotes and specific recommendations, the book promotes an undeniably feasible yet decidedly offbeat program that has worked for the author and could prove equally favorable for others who apply it. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>&#x201c;Tim Sanders shows us that being a &#x2018;lovecat&#x2019; is a great business strategy and I wholeheartedly agree.

She promises Sweet Pea that when she is fully healed a special treat awaits her in the greenhouse: a sleepover with all of her farm friends. Sweet Pea and the other farm animals like many of the same things young children enjoy when sleeping over at friends' houses such as eating delicious food, dressing up, dancing, and listening to bedtime stories.

Articulating the obvious patterns of behavior, of both a group of participants and as facilitators, this manual holds one's hand and eradicates excuses surrounding touchy subjects, personal triggers, internalized self-doubt, and our common journey to unveil if not dismantle complex systems of oppression. After 10 years of doing this work, I feel more prepared to continue and wish I had this tool a decade ago. (Jessica Pettitt, certified speaking professional, www.GoodEnoughNow.com)<br><br>Caprice &amp; Ilsa have taken Richard Bach's admonition to heart in this book: &#x201c;Learning is finding out what we already know. Doing is demonstrating that you know it. Teaching is reminding others that they know just as well as you." Their fabulous book helps new and seasoned facilitators learn, do and teach so that participants in these conversations can approach conversations on race with open hearts and grace. (LueRachelle Brim-Atkins, principal consultant, Brim-Donahoe &amp; Associates in Seattle, WA)<br><br>Leading one of the most diverse school districts in the nation requires me to not only continue to develop my own cultural competency but to ensure our school community also invests itself in this lifelong work. Dr. Caprice Hollins and Ilsa Govan have produced an invaluable tool-kit that drives home how race, prejudice and bias impact our society and the schoolhouse. They provide us with practical exercises and strategies to shepherd personal and institutional growth. Through understanding, not judgment, they help us to see the world through a compassionate lens that enables us to push one another toward greater competence while cultivating the human goodness we each possess. The authors, both with strong backgrounds in education, demonstrate profound understanding of the complexity of this work. This book ought to be considered foundational for all school leaders as we collective deliver on the moral imperative of creating a more equitable and just society. (Nancy Coogan, superintendent; Tukwila School District, WA State)<br><br>Wow! This book is the most practical, comprehensive, useful guide for facilitating courageous conversations on race that I've ever read. I've attended a few of Cultures Connecting workshops and have been impressed with the facilitators' ability to create dynamic, inclusive AND challenging workshops that move everyone forward in their cultural competence. The expertise that Caprice and Ilsa offer in this book is invaluable for any facilitator wanting to grow their skills. I cannot recommend it enough and will definitely use these strategies in future trainings I facilitate. (Allison Cohen, executive director, Refugee Immigrant Services Northwest)<br><br>As the lead trainer for the YWCA of Seattle|King|Snohomish and an activist for 20 years, I believe that Caprice Hollins and Ilsa Govan have created an extremely effective way to have courageous conversation around race and racism. Their organized approach, along with an understanding of how the human mind comprehends information and the human heart processes feelings around cultural competency, race and racism is outstanding. As culturally competent training around race has become a cornerstone to effective policy and program solutions, their book could not come at a better time. (Indira Bahner, MSW Social Justice Coordinator)<br><br>Do you have a passion to authentically penetrate one of the most unfinished conversations in the United States? This thought-provoking book offers: An opportunity to extend on how you currently engage folks in courageous discussions on &#x201c;race&#x201d; while simultaneously strengthening your own reflective journey towards cultural competence! I encourage you to do what I have done-to grasp onto the gift of this radiant vision and interweave it&#x2019;s brilliance into your present work! (Debra Jenkins, MA, MS, professor of early childhood education and psychology, Founder of Share the Flame Strategies for Growth, Development, and Change)<br><br>The illumination that there is no 'one right way to engage in conversations about racism, power and privilege' was very freeing. Caprice and Ilsa offer a number of strategies and thoughtful approaches on how we can respectfully engage in often-difficult conversations, which helps to keep me mindful that the onus is on me, not the other person. Since reading this book, I am moved to discard my tired mantra of 'if only I had said' and revise it to 'if only I had asked.' I can see how this little change can advance a conversation in a very powerful way! (Susan McCallister, Planning and Development Specialist, Senior,Seattle Human Services Department)<br><br>Caprice D. Hollins and Ilsa M. Govan have created an honest and forthright, multiple perspectives guide for all levels of racial and social justice workshop facilitators. From how to organize and maximize the physical space and create a productive, engaging atmosphere, to methods for redirecting those who attempt to control the conversation, this guide offers direction for engaging in honest, critical dialogue. Authors offer ways to scaffold prior knowledge, defuse intercultural conflict and engage in the introspective reflection required to be successful in social justice activism. A welcome addition to the field.

His mother, fearing for his life, led him across the border. So began Enaiat&#x2019;s remarkable and often publishing five-year ordeal&#x2014;trekking across bitterly cold mountains, riding the suffocating false bottom of a truck, steering an inflatable raft in violent waters&#x2014;through Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, and Greece, before he eventually sought political asylum in Italy, all before he turned fifteen years old.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here Fabio Geda delivers the moving true story of Enaiat&#x2019;s extraordinary will to survive and of the accidental brotherhood he found with the boys he met along the way. <i>In the Sea There Are Crocodiles</i> brilliantly captures Enaiat&#x2019;s engaging voice and humor, in what is a truly epic story of hope and survival, for readers of all ages.</p></p><p><p><b>Fabio Geda </b>is an Italian novelist who works with children under duress. He writes for several Italian magazines and newspapers and teaches creative writing at Scuola Holden, the Italian school of storytelling in Turin. This is his first book to be translated into English.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Enaiatollah Akbari </b>graduated from high school in the spring of 2011 and plans to attend university in Italy while continuing to support his mother and siblings, who are now living in Pakistan. He dreams of having the chance to return one day to a democratic and peaceful Afghanistan.</p><b><br>AFGHANISTAN </b><br><br>The thing is, I really wasn&#x2019;t expecting her to go. Because when you&#x2019;re ten years old and getting ready for bed, on a night that&#x2019;s just like any other night, no darker or starrier or more silent or more full of smells than usual, with the familiar sound of the muezzins calling the faithful to prayer from the tops of the minarets just like any- where else... no, when you&#x2019;re ten years old&#x2014;I say ten, although I&#x2019;m not entirely sure when I was born, because there&#x2019;s no registry office or anything like that in Ghazni province&#x2014;like I said, when you&#x2019;re ten years old, and your mother, before putting you to bed, takes your head and holds it against her breast for a long time, longer than usual, and says, There are three things you must never do in life, Enaiat <i>jan</i>, for any reason... The first is use drugs. Some of them taste good and smell good and they whisper in your ear that they&#x2019;ll make you feel better than you could ever feel without them. Don&#x2019;t believe them. Promise me you won&#x2019;t do it.<br> &nbsp;<br> I promise.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second is use weapons. Even if someone hurts your feelings or damages your memories, or insults God, the earth or men, promise me you&#x2019;ll never pick up a gun, or a knife, or a stone, or even the wooden ladle we use for making <i>qhorma palaw</i>, if that ladle can be used to hurt someone. Promise.<br> &nbsp;<br> I promise.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third is cheat or steal. What&#x2019;s yours belongs to you, what isn&#x2019;t doesn&#x2019;t. You can earn the money you need by working, even if the work is hard. You must never cheat anyone, Enaiat <i>jan</i>, all right? You must be hospitable and tolerant to everyone. Promise me you&#x2019;ll do that.<br> &nbsp;<br> I promise.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, even when your mother says things like that and then, still stroking your neck, looks up at the window and starts talking about dreams, dreams like the moon, which at night is so bright you can see to eat by it, and about wishes&#x2014;how you must always have a wish in front of your eyes, like a donkey with a carrot, and how it&#x2019;s in trying to satisfy our wishes that we find the strength to pick ourselves up, and if you hold a wish up high, any wish, just in front of your forehead, then life will always be worth living&#x2014;well, even when your mother, as she helps you get to sleep, says all these things in a strange, low voice as warming as embers, and fills the silence with words, this woman who&#x2019;s always been so sharp, so quick- witted in dealing with life... even at a time like that, it doesn&#x2019;t occur to you that what she&#x2019;s really saying is, <i>Khoda negahdar</i>, goodbye.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just like that.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I opened my eyes in the morning, I had a good stretch to wake myself up, then reached over to my right, feeling for the comforting presence of my mother&#x2019;s body. The reassuring smell of her skin always said to me, Wake up, get out of bed, come on...But my hand felt nothing, only the white cotton cover between my fingers. I pulled it toward me. I turned over, with my eyes wide open. I propped myself on my elbows and tried calling out, Mother. But she didn&#x2019;t reply and no one replied in her place. She wasn&#x2019;t on the mattress, she wasn&#x2019;t in the room where we had slept, which was still warm with bodies tossing and turning in the half-light, she wasn&#x2019;t in the doorway, she wasn&#x2019;t at the window looking out at the street filled with cars and carts and bikes, she wasn&#x2019;t next to the water jars or in the smokers&#x2019; corner talking to someone, as she had often been during those three days.<br> &nbsp;<br> From outside came the din of Quetta, which is much, much noisier than my little village in Ghazni, that strip of land, houses and streams that I come from, the most beautiful place in the world (and I&#x2019;m not just boasting, it&#x2019;s true).<br> &nbsp;<br> Little or big.<br> &nbsp;<br> It didn&#x2019;t occur to me that the reason for all that din might be because we were in a big city. I thought it was just one of the normal differences between countries, like different ways of seasoning meat. I thought the sound of Pakistan was simply different from the sound of Afghanistan, and that every country had its own sound, which depended on a whole lot of things, like what people ate and how they moved around.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mother, I called.<br> &nbsp;<br> No answer. So I got out from under the covers, put my shoes on, rubbed my eyes and went to find the owner of the place to ask if he&#x2019;d seen her, because three days earlier, as soon as we arrived, he&#x2019;d told us that no one went in or out without him noticing, which seemed odd to me, since I assumed that even he needed to sleep from time to time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sun cut the entrance of the <i>samavat</i> Qgazi in two. <i>Samavat</i> means &#x201c;hotel.&#x201d; In that part of the world, they actually call those places hotels, but they&#x2019;re nothing like what you think of as a hotel, Fabio. The <i>samavat </i>Qgazi wasn&#x2019;t so much a hotel as a warehouse for bodies and souls, a kind of left-luggage office you cram into and then wait to be packed up and sent off to Iran or Afghanistan or wherever, a place to make contact with people traffickers.<br> &nbsp;<br> We had been in the <i>samavat</i> for three days, never going out, me playing among the cushions, Mother talking to groups of women with children, some with whole families, people she seemed to trust.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember that, all the time we were in Quetta, my mother kept her face and body bundled up inside a <i>burqa</i>. In our house in Nava, with my aunt or with her friends, she never wore a <i>burqa</i>. I didn&#x2019;t even know she had one. The first time I saw her put it on, at the border, I asked her why and she said with a smile, It&#x2019;s a game, Enaiat, come inside. She lifted a flap of the garment, and I slipped between her legs and under the blue fabric. It was like diving into a swimming pool, and I held my breath, even though I wasn&#x2019;t swimming.<br> &nbsp;<br> Covering my eyes with my hand because of the light, I walked up to the owner, <i>kaka</i> Rahim, and apologized for bothering him. I asked about my mother, if by any chance he&#x2019;d seen her go out, because nobody went in or out without him noticing, right?</p><h2>The Effective Hiring Manager</h2><p><p><b>Essential hiring and team-building lessons </b><b>from the #1 Podcaster in the world</b></p> <p><i>The Effective Hiring Manager</i> offers an essential guide for managers, team leaders, and HR professionals in organizations large or small.

This is indeed a rhetorical question that for many years historians have begun chapters with. As well they should. For the American Revolution is without a doubt the single most important historical event to occur in this nation except of course for Super Bowl III (Jets 16. Colts 7. This historian won $35).&#x201d;<br><br>So goes the skewed sensibility, the muddied mind, the bent pen of one of America's funniest writers, Dave Barry. This time his subject is U.S. history, the way it's never been told before. Every single momentous event and crucial moment is covered, including . . .&nbsp;<br><br>� The Birthing Contractions of a Nation<br>� Kicking Some British Butt<br>� Barging Westward<br>� The Forging of a Large, Wasteful Bureaucracy<br>� Deep Economic Doo-doo<br>� The Fifties: Peace, Prosperity, Brain Death<br><br>. . . and right up through the scintillating Reagan-Bush years, during which, Mr. Barry notes, America is steadfastly Napping Toward Glory.<br><br>If you love to laugh, if you love your country, if you are unaware that&nbsp;&#x201c;the Sixth Amendment states that if you are accused of a crime, you have a right to a trial before a jury of people too stupid to get out of jury duty,&#x201d; <i>Dave Barry Slept Here </i>is the book you've been waiting for since 1776. Or at least since Super Bowl III.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Dave Barry Slept Here</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A dazzling performance . . . Barry is brilliant.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Dave] Barry turns his formidable wit to the subject of American history, with a result reminiscent of the Reduced Shakespeare Company: The better you know the original, the funnier it gets.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;I fear that Mr. Barry's dream of making millions of dollars through mass sales of his book to a captive audience of innocent schoolchildren will not be realized, and he will have to be content with making readers laugh a lot, as this one did.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>Dave runs American history through the wringer, and comes up with some wonderfully warped formulations. (The Vikings, for example, "were extremely rugged individuals whose idea of a fun time was to sail over and set fire to England, which in those days was fairly easy to ignite because it had a very high level of thatch, this being the kind of roof favored by the local tribespeople...") Covering pre-Columbian days through the dawn of the Bush administration, <b>Dave Barry Slept Here</b> is the funniest thing to hit this great nation since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930.Although Dave lampoons and distorts every event in American history as only he can do, I think I learned more from this book from all my history courses.<br><br>Every time I see another Dave Barry book, I wonder how it is that Florida can produce not one, but TWO humorists: Dave and Carl Hiaason (TEAM RODENT, NATIVE TONGUE, SKIN TIGHT). They're both national treasures! Maybe there's something about that steamy heat...</p><h2>The Voyeur&#39;s Motel</h2><p>On January 7, 1980, in the run-up to the publication of his landmark bestseller <i>Thy Neighbor&#x2019;s Wife</i>, Gay Talese received an anonymous handwritten letter from a man in Colorado. Since learning of your long-awaited study of coast-to-coast sex in America,&#x201d; the letter began, I feel I have important information that I could contribute to its contents or to contents of a future book.&#x201d;<br><br>The man went on to tell Talese an astonishing secret: he had bought a motel outside Denver to satisfy his voyeuristic desires. Underneath the roof of his motel, the man had built an observation platform,&#x201d; fitted with vents, through which he could watch his unwitting guests.<br><br>Unsure what to make of this confession, Talese traveled to Colorado where he met the man Gerald Foos and verified his story in person. But because Foos insisted on remaining anonymous, preserving for himself the privacy he denied his guests, Talese filed his reporting away, assuming the story would remain untold.<br><br>Over the ensuing years, Foos occasionally reached out to Talese to fill him in on the latest developments in his life. He also sent Talese hundreds of pages of notes on his guests and their habits, work that Foos believed made him a pioneering researcher into American society and sexuality. America in microcosm had passed through the Voyeur&#x2019;s motel, and he witnessed and recorded the harsh effects of the war in Vietnam, the upheaval in gender roles, the decline of segregation, and much more. But Foos continued to insist on anonymity. Now, after thirty-five years, he&#x2019;s ready to go public and Gay Talese can finally tell his story.<br><br><i>The Voyeur&#x2019;s Motel</i> is an extraordinary work of narrative journalism, at once a portrait of one complicated man, and an examination of secret lives and shifting mores in a culturally-evolving country.</p><p><b>Gay Talese</b> was born in Ocean City, New Jersey, in 1932, to Italian immigrant parents. He attended the University of Alabama, and after graduating was hired as a copyboy at the <i>New York Times</i>.<br><br>After a brief stint in the army, Talese returned to the <i>New York Times</i> in 1956. Since then he has written for numerous publications, including <i>Esquire</i>, the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>. It was these articles that led Tom Wolfe to credit Gay Talese with the creation of an inventive form of nonfiction writing called The New Journalism.&#x201d;<br><br>Talese&#x2019;s bestselling books have dealt with the history and influence of the <i>New York Times</i> (<i>The Kingdom and the Power</i>); the inside story of a Mafia family (<i>Honor Thy Father</i>); his father&#x2019;s immigration to America from Italy in the years preceding World War II (<i>Unto the Sons</i>); and the changing moral values of America in the period between World War II and the AIDS epidemic (<i>Thy Neighbor&#x2019;s Wife</i>).<br><br>Gay Talese lives with his wife, Nan, in New York City.<b>Praise for <i>The Voyeur&#x2019;s Motel</i>:</b><br> <br> <b>Named a Best Book of the Year by the <i>Daily Mail</i> (Event Critics&#x2019; Selection)</b><br> <br> &#x201c;This book flipped nearly all of my switches as a reader.

Turning to the magic, mystery, and decadence of Venice, Berendt gradually reveals the truth behind a sensational fire that in 1996 destroyed the historic Fenice opera house. Encountering a rich cast of characters, Berendt tells a tale full of atmosphere and surprise as the stories build, one after the other, ultimately coming together to portray a world as finely drawn as a still-life painting.</p><p><p> <strong>Past <i>Midnight</i>: John Berendt on the Mysteries of Venice</strong> </p><p> Just as John Berendt's first book, <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>, was settling into its remarkable four-year run on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list, he discovered a new city whose local mysteries and traditions were more than a match for Savannah, whose hothouse eccentricities he had celebrated in the first book. The new city was Venice, and he spent much of the last decade wandering through its canals and palazzos, seeking to understand a place that any native will tell you is easy to visit but hard to know. For travelers to Venice, whether by armchair or vaporetto, he has selected his 10 (actually 11) Books to Read on Venice. And he took the time to answer a few of our questions about his charming new book, <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>: </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The lush, cloistered southern city of Savannah was the locale of <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>. Venice, the setting for <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>, is vastly different. Was it the difference itself that drew you to Venice? </p><p><strong>John Berendt:</strong> Savannah and Venice actually have quite a lot in common. Both are uniquely beautiful. Both are isolated geographically, culturally, and emotionally from the world outside. Venice sits in the middle of a lagoon; Savannah is surrounded by marshes, piney woods, and the ocean. Venetians think of themselves as Venetian first, Italian second; Savannahians rarely even venture forth as far as Atlanta or Charleston. So both cities offer a writer a rich context in which to set a story, and the stories provide readers a means of escape from their own environment into another world. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> I enjoyed your rather declarative author's note: that this is a work of nonfiction, and that you used everyone's real names. In your previous book you did use pseudonyms for some characters and you explained that you took a few small liberties in the service of the larger truth of the story. Why the change this time? </p><p><strong>Berendt:</strong> When I wrote <i>Midnight</i> I thought I would do a few people the favor of changing their names for the sake of privacy. But when the book came out, several of the pseudonymous characters told me they wished I'd used their real names instead. So this time, no pseudonyms. As for the storytelling liberties I took in writing <i>Midnight</i>, they were minor and did not change the story, but my mention of it in the author's note caused some confusion, with the result that <i>Midnight</i> is sometimes referred to now as a novel, which it most certainly is not. Neither is <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>. In fact, I dispensed with the liberties this time and made it as close to the truth as I could get it. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>, a number of fascinating people serve as guides to the city, each with a different idea of the true nature of Venice. Who was your favorite? </p><p><strong>Berendt:</strong> I don't have a favorite, but Count Girolamo Marcello is certainly a memorable, highly quotable commentator. "Everyone in Venice is acting," he told me. "Everyone plays a role, and the role changes. The key to understanding Venetians is rhythm, the rhythm of the lagoon, the water, the tides, the waves. It's like breathing. High water, high pressure: tense. Low water, low pressure: relaxed. The tide changes every six hours." </p><p>I nodded that I understood. </p><p>"How do you see a bridge?" he went on. </p><p>"Pardon me?" I asked, "A bridge?" </p><p>"Do you see a bridge as an obstacle--as just another set of steps to climb to get from one side of a canal to the other? We Venetians do not see bridges as obstacles. To us, bridges are transitions. We go over them very slowly. They are part of the rhythm. They are the links between two parts of a theater, like changes in scenery. Our role changes as we go over bridges. We cross from one reality ... to another reality. From one street ... to another street. From one setting ... to another setting." </p><p>Once I had absorbed that notion, Count Marcello continued: "Sunlight on a canal is reflected up through a window onto the ceiling, then from the ceiling onto a vase, and from the vase onto a glass. Which is the real sunlight? Which is the real reflection? What is true? What is not true? The answer is not so simple, because the truth can change. I can change. You can change. That is the Venice effect." </p><p>I was not terribly surprised when he later told me, "Venetians never tell the truth. We mean precisely the opposite of what we say." </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Now that you know Venice well enough to be a guide yourself, what would you say to a visitor looking for insight into the character of the city? </p><p><strong>Berendt:</strong> Tourists generally shuffle along, on narrow streets so crowded as to be nearly impassable, between the major sights of St. Mark's Square, the Rialto Bridge, and the Accademia Museum. All you have to do is to step off these heavily traveled alleyways, and in a few moments you will find yourself in quiet, much emptier surroundings. This is more like the real Venice. Another thing to do is to go into the wine bars where Venetians stand around drinking and talking. They will very likely be speaking the Venetian dialect, so you won't be able to understand them, but you will get a sampling of the true Venetian ambiance enlivened by the pronounced sing-song rhythm of the language. I'd also suggest stopping someone in the street and asking for directions. Almost invariably, you will be rewarded with a genial smile and the instructions, <i>Sempre diritto</i>, meaning "Straight ahead." This will only leave you more confused, because when you attempt to follow a straight line, you will be confronted by more twists and turns and forks in the road than you thought possible, given the instructions. This is part of what Count Marcello described as "the Venice effect." </p>John Berendt has been a columnist for <i>Esquire</i> and the editor of <i>New York</i> magazine, and is the author of <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>, which was a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction.</p><h2>The Power of Positive Self-Talk</h2><p>Many people are used to showing compassion to others.

Evan Stark, founder of one of America's first battered women's shelters, shows how "domestic violence" is neither primarily domestic nor necessarily violent, but a pattern of controlling behaviors more akin to terrorism and hostage-taking. Drawing on court records, interviews, and FBI statistics, Stark details coercive strategies that men use to deny women their very personhood, from "beeper games" to food logs to micromanaging dress, speech, sexual activity, and work. Stark urges us to move beyond the injury model and focus on the real victimization that allows men to violate women's human rights with impunity. Provocative and brilliantly argued, <em>Coercive Control</em> reframes abuse as a liberty crime rather than a crime of assault and points the way to bringing "real" equality for women in line with their formal rights to personhood and citizenship, freedom and safety.<br></p><p><br><strong>Evan Stark</strong> is an award-winning researcher and has served as an expert in over l00 cases involving battered women and their children. He teaches at the Rutgers School of Public Affairs and Administration and Chairs the Department of Urban Health Administration at the UMDNJ School of Public Health. With Dr. Anne Flitcraft he is the coauthor of <em>Women at Risk: Domestic Violence and Women's Health</em>. He lives in Woodbridge, Connecticutt.<br><br>"Regardless of whether readers agree or disagree with Stark's contentions or agree only in part, we guarantee they will not ever be bored. It is hoped that this book will be widely read and discussed and its major points incorporated into our daily work.

What a story. I have read all of the Ashes and Embers stories and could not wait to read this new one. I've always been so fascinated by Asher and to get a glimpse of him in this story was great. This story is about his daughter, Kenzi, and Asher's best friend, Toren, who was smoking hot and just so freaking romantic. I won't rehash the plot, but what a great love story and journey. Love, it's what all these characters have in common, and it comes in all different forms. What happens when someone you have loved since you were born becomes the romantic love of your life?

The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind.</em><br> -Henry James</p> <p> One sunny afternoon in June, my sister Jenny and I were walking home from school when we noticed a loud chirping coming from an empty trashcan on the curb. We walked over to it and peered inside. A sad little sparrow was sitting at the bottom of the trashcan, chirping his heart out. His right wing stuck out from his body at a strange angle. Jenny said it was probably broken. She reached in and cupped the bird in her hands, cooing to him so he wouldn't be scared. The sparrow chirped all the way to our house, his little, fuzzy head poking through Jenny&#x2019;s fingers.</p> <p>My mom took one look at the little bird and said, &#x201c;No way! I&#x2019;m not having another animal in the house.&#x201d; But once she got a closer look at those big, sad eyes and heard that pathetic chirping, her heart melted. We were counting on that. </p> <p>Mom sent me into the bathroom for tape and an eyedropper and gently set the sparrow on the kitchen table to get a better look at him. She said his right wing was definitely broken, so she designed a splint out of a Popsicle stick and carefully taped it to his wing. Our dog, Buttons, kept trying to get a look at the bird, but we shooed her away.<br> <br> Once the splint was on, we fed the bird water with an eyedropper and gave him bits of bread and berries. At first he wouldn't eat, but then after awhile, he wouldn't stop.</p> <p>The little bird earned the name Peep. We kept him in an old hamster cage, former home of Pepper, the hamster, who&#x2019;d recently passed away from old age. Every night, we put a towel over the cage, and Peep went right to sleep. And every morning, we put his cage outside and opened the door so he could wander around and get some fresh air. Peep couldn't fly, which seemed to frustrate him. He wasn't used to walking everywhere. Eventually, Peep made friends with Buttons. I swear it's true! Peep would jump onto Button&#x2019;s back for a free ride around the back yard.</p> <p>After awhile, Peep's wing got better, and Mom told us it was probably time to take off the splint. We put Peep on the kitchen table, and Mom cut off most of the splint with little scissors. She couldn't get all of it, so there were bits of white tape stuck to his wing, but he didn't seem to mind. He started flapping his wing like crazy, and the next morning when we opened the cage door, he flew about fifty feet into the air before coming back. We watched from the ground like proud parents. From then on, Peep flew further each morning, but he always came back.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on a Sunday morning, when Jenny let Peep out of his cage, he just kept flying. We left his cage outside with the door open, but he never came home all that day. As it became dark, we faced the truth that Peep would never come back. My mom said he probably found some other sparrows and decided it was time to be with his own kind. My eyes filled with tears, and so did Jenny&#x2019;s. We all missed Peep a lot&#x2014;even Buttons, who paced around in front of his cage every morning for weeks.</p> <p>A few months later, Jenny and I were walking home from school, and a sparrow landed on a low tree branch just ahead of where we were walking. We both stopped and stared at it, amazed. The bird had little bits of white tape stuck to his right wing. </p> <p>Jenny and I didn't say a word to each other. Peep sat on the branch chirping at us for a couple of seconds, and then he flew off. We watched him join a little flock of sparrows and disappear into the sky with them. We decided that it wasn't one of those crazy coincidences. Peep had come to say a proper good-bye and to thank us for saving his life.</p> <p>-Yvonne Prinz</p> <p><strong>Winter Warmth </strong><br> <br> <em>When you carry out acts of kindness, you get a wonderful feeling inside. It is as though something inside your body responds and says, yes, this is how I ought to feel.</em><br> -Harold Kushner<br> <br> Whoosh! Ahhhh . . . the sound of my sled sliding on top of the snow! It was what I had been looking forward to ever since the beginning of winter. </p> <p>It was a long hike up to the top of the snow hill, the snow crunching under my boots. My arms ached from pulling the sled. The wind tore at my face, and my eyes filled with tears from the cold wind. But it would all be worth it in a minute.<br> I got to the top of the hill and lay stomach-down on the sled to begin the fast trip down. Everything was a blur as I flew down the hill. Whoosh! There's that great sound! Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye. <br> When I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked around for what had caught my attention. Then, I saw a woman pushing a shopping cart. The snow-covered sidewalk made it hard for her to walk. As she got closer, I noticed that she had on several thin coats and a couple of hats, and her fingers were showing through her gloves. I knew in an instant that she was a homeless person. She looked very tired, cold and helpless. My heart sank. How could I be enjoying this weather that someone else was dreading?</p> <p>I watched her struggle to push the cart. I wanted to help her, but what could I do? Then I remembered the church at the top of the hill. </p> <p>I ran up the hill, dragging the sled through the parking lot and into the church. I saw a man cleaning the floor, and I told him about the woman. He followed me outside. The woman was still struggling up the sidewalk with the cart. The man walked up to her and told her not to be afraid, that he worked at the church and he could help her. He said that the church was taking in homeless people for the weekend, and she was welcome to come inside, have something to eat and get warm. <br> The homeless woman looked so grateful! I felt so good that I couldn&#x2019;t stop smiling. <br> When I went outside, snow was falling softly, and it made me feel peaceful. Once again, I lay on my stomach and started down the hill. Only this time, the wind seemed gentle, my eyes didn&#x2019;t water from the cold, and I felt warm inside. What a great day!</p> <p>-Alese Bagdol, 11</p> <p>�2006. All rights reserved.

Okoro approaches Advent a little differently, inviting us to sit for a while with Zechariah and Elizabeth and the story of how they came to bear their only son, John. The Advent story we so often associate with the joy of Christmas actually begins with deep sorrow and longing. But thankfully, in the kingdom of God, there is always more to the story than meets the eye, Enuma Okoro writes. Zechariah and Elizabeth were good people. They had maintained faith and hope in God for many years, despite Elizabeth s inability to conceive, a condition considered shameful in their time. So they were quite familiar with the universal human experiences of longing and waiting. Even though this couple s story takes up only one chapter in Luke s Gospel, it contains enough lessons about faith and life to last for weeks. In her beautifully written, imaginative meditations for each day of Advent, Okoro looks closely at the doubts and longings of Zechariah and Elizabeth. As you explore their story, Okoro guides you to reflect on your own experiences of waiting and longing, of grief and the need for community, and of hungering for God. These poetic and poignant meditations will linger with you long after Christmas. Reflection questions and a prayer challenge accompany each week s meditations. A perfect book for individual or group study.</p><p>Sit for a while with Zechariah and Elizabeth. Feel their longings and doubts, and then witness their surprise as an angel tells Zechariah that they will finally become parents in their old age. See what happens when Zechariah dares to question God&#39;s messenger. What blessings emerge from his time of silence? In this imaginative approach to the Advent story, Okoro leads you to reflect on the meaning of waiting, living with the unknown, and trusting God.Enuma Okoro is a writer, speaker, and retreat leader.

How do dogs know when their owners are returning home at unexpected times? How can horses find their way back to the stable over completely unfamiliar terrain?<br><br>After five years of extensive research involving thousands of people who have pets and work with animals, Dr. Sheldrake proves conclusively what many pet owners already know: there is a strong connection between humans and animals that defies present-day scientific understanding. Sheldrake compellingly demonstrates that we and our pets are social animals linked together by invisible bonds connecting animals to each other, to their owners, and to their homes in powerful ways. His provocative ideas about these social, or morphic, fields explain the uncanny behavior often observed in pets and help provide an explanation for amazing animal behavior in the wild, such as migration and homing.<br><br><i>Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home</i> not only provides fascinating insight into animal, and human, behavior, but also teaches us to question the boundaries of conventional scientific thought, and shows that the very animals who are closest to us have much to teach us about biology, nature, and consciousness.</p><p>It's rare for a book's title to say so clearly what the book is about. In the case of Rupert Sheldrake's latest work, the controversial content is right on the front cover. Pet owners will see it and smile in recognition; skeptical scientists will shake their heads and mutter about "maverick scholars." We all know of cases of dogs (and cats) who know when their owners are coming home, who go to wait at the door or window 10 minutes or more before their human arrives. Conditioned by the tight rigor of contemporary scientific thinking, we either look for rational explanations or we file the phenomenon away in our minds as "unexplained" and are careful not to talk about it with our scientist friends. <p> Sheldrake has shown in the past that he is not afraid to be labeled a rebel, thanks to his theory of morphic resonance, which suggests the following: </p><blockquote>Natural systems, or morphic units, at all levels of complexity are animated, organized, and coordinated by morphic fields, which contain an inherent memory. Natural systems inherit this collective memory from all previous things of their kind by a process called morphic resonance, with the result that patterns of development and behavior become increasingly habitual through repetition.</blockquote><p> Sheldrake believes that the "telepathy" between pets and humans, or between flocks of birds or schools of fish that move as a single organism, can be explained this theory. Sheldrake is less persuaded by anecdotes that suggest animal clairvoyance--warning of something in the near future--but refuses to disallow the possibility.</p><p> He accepts that the case histories he details so thoroughly in this book are anecdotal, but that makes them no less real; and as a scientist himself he sets up experimental conditions for studying this previously ignored phenomenon that show beyond any doubt that the phenomenon exists. He castigates traditional scientists for their refusal to countenance anything that doesn't fit in with their existing paradigms (or prejudices) and challenges them to come up with some more "acceptable" explanation--but none is forthcoming. </p><p> This fascinating book is a first attempt at a scientific investigation into a puzzling but quite common occurrence. One hopes that other scientists will follow Sheldrake's brave lead. <i>--David V. Barrett</i></p>who have ever owned a pet will swear that their dog or cat or other animal has exhibited some kind of behavior they just can't explain. How does a dog know when its owner is returning home at an unexpected time? How do cats know when it is time to go to the vet, even before the cat carrier comes out? How do horses find their way back to the stable over completely unfamiliar terrain? And how can some pets predict that their owners are about to have an epileptic fit?<br><br>These intriguing questions about animal behavior convinced world-renowned biologist Rupert Sheldrake that the very animals who are closest to us have much to teach us about biology, nature, and consciousness. <br><br>Filled with captivating stories and thought-provoking analysis, <b>Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home</b> is a groundbreaking exploration of animal behavior that will profoundly change the way we think about animals, and ourselves.

So why don&#39;t we experience his presence more? Life is full of distractions, and our 24/7 news cycles and social media drown out the voice of God. It&#39;s hard to discern God&#39;s presence amid the hubbub. But experiencing God is not just for the super-spiritual or ultra-mature. Every Christian can learn to cultivate a greater awareness of God in the everyday. Ken Boa offers a contemporary guide to practicing the presence of God. Using biblical foundations, living and historical examples, and evidence from neuroscience, Ken reveals how we can walk with God and abide in his presence. We need to rethink how we use our time and technology to make room for God, to train ourselves with new habits that deepen our awareness of God. This book offers not a magical technique but dozens of practical exercises and disciplines that help us draw close to God even in the midst of our cacophonous modern culture. Practicing God&#39;s presence is not just for the professionals. It&#39;s for ordinary people like us. And the more we live in God&#39;s presence, the greater our abiding peace and joy.</p><p>"Few, if any, authors have impacted my spiritual life like Ken Boa has. I have known Ken personally for over thirty years and never am I not challenged in my walk with Christ when in Ken's presence, literally or through something he has written. This book to me embodies Ken's life message. Living in the presence of God by practicing that presence of God is the only life worth living. This book is not only challenging but extraordinarily practical." (Ron Blue, Kingdom Advisors)<br><br>"Ken Boa consistently reminds us that a truly Biblical worldview is more than an academic exercise or simply having the right intellectual thoughts about God. It's about knowing him, who is the truth, and living in light of that reality and in relationship with Christ everywhere, every minute. Like everything Boa writes, this book will lead you more deeply into that reality and relationship." (John Stonestreet, president, The Colson Center for Christian Worldview, cohost, BreakPoint Radio)<br><br>"Ken Boa's writings have played a major role in my spiritual growth and development for over twenty years. This volume will move to the top of my favorite books by him. I long to experience more of God in this noisy and busy world, and Ken has provided a fresh, practical, biblical pathway filled with wisdom, insight, and theological depth. I highly recommend it." (Chip Ingram, Living on the Edge, pastor, Venture Christian Church)<br><br>"As the old adage says, 'We are known by the company we keep!' And, I might add, we will be known in positive, life-transforming ways by keeping company with Jesus. But the challenge is getting our heads and hearts around the discipline of practicing his presence. Thankfully, Ken Boa helps us! <em>Life in the Presence of God</em> is a clear and compelling guide to the joy of intimacy with Christ." (Joseph M. Stowell, president, Cornerstone University, Grand Rapids)<br><br>"In his latest book, my friend Ken Boa has restored my appreciation for the word <em>practical</em>. Too often, help in living the Christian life that claims to be practical offers little more than simplistic solutions to surface problems. Dr. Boa gives no such help. With clear writing, passionate hope, and spiritual wisdom, he provides biblical direction that will lead anyone hungry for God into his presence. This book deserves a careful read and an even more productive reread. Expect to discover practical guidance to satisfy the deepest longings of the human soul." (Larry Crabb, New Way Ministries)<br><br>"In this book, Ken Boa states that we can live the kind of unified, spiritually rich life we're meant to live. From cover to cover, he backs up this claim with biblical verification, illustrations, and practical solutions to help readers achieve a greater measure of this kind of life. I recommend it!" (Gene A. Getz, professor, pastor, author, president of the Center for Church Renewal)<br><br>"Ah, at last a modern mentor guides us into the ancient path of practicing the presence of God! <em>Life in the Presence of God</em> will stir your soul to see (and give you tools to seek) an enduring nearness with God that remains steady and satisfying regardless of the temperature of our emotions or the changes in our scenery." (Alicia Britt Chole, author of The Sacred Slow)<br><br>"God is everywhere all the time. But how can we become aware of God's ongoing presence and activity? How can we live an abundant life of constant communion with God? In this book, Ken Boa draws on Brother Lawrence and other practitioners of God's presence to answer these questions. But Ken goes beyond their examples and advice by providing a comprehensive guidebook full of specific, practical suggestions. Those hungering for sustained intimacy with the triune God will welcome his rich insights and recommendations." (James Taylor, professor of philosophy, Westmont College)<br><br>"He's done it again. In <em>Life in the Presence of God</em>, Ken Boa takes on one of the most important principles of living a Christ-centered life and provides a clear road map of insight and application. Like so many admonitions in Scripture, the idea of abiding in Christ appears to be straightforward but proves more challenging, even elusive, in practice. Exactly what does 'abide in Christ' mean, and how does one do that? Boa creatively blends Scripture, spiritual principles, and the testimonies of historical figures who modeled a life of abiding in Christ together in a clear, practical manner that makes this wonderful promise more accessible for the rest of us."

He lives in Portland, Oregon. <b>A.B. Chitty</b> works as a librarian systems officer at Queens College. He lives in Yonkers, New York.Management's perpetual dream of cheap labor explains the invention of slavery, though few may couch it in those terms. Drawing such connections with impressive evenhandedness and investigative and analytic acuity, this readable popular history covers U.S. labor from precolonial times to the late 1960s, with two short chapters on the last few decades. Brandishing little-known facts, the authors reshape common views of social history. Remarkably, for instance, hundreds of black indentured servants came to the colonies fromAfricain the 1600s, and throughout the century, as the "peculiar institution" was legalized, these free men and women were forced into slavery. Less astonishing but still significant, the Wobblies pushed as much for free speech as union organizing, and their newspapers were illustrated by famous avant-garde artists. Sometimes the authors simply highlight an obvious fact that has languished in obscurity for instance, that the American Revolution was sparked by the discontent of working people, not the wealthy or landowning, or that many defenders of slavery believed that all labor should be enslaved. Murolo (who teaches American history at Sarah Lawrence College) and Chitty (a librarian at Queens College) gracefully handle a broad range of subject matter Chinese railroad labor is considered alongside housework and steel-mill work making it easier to understand the complex historical relationships between work, gender, ethnicity, race, immigration and sex.

With origins possibly dating to sixth century Buddhism, the art of creating shapes from pieces of paper offers an appealing combination of calming concentration and the opportunity to create small works of art with our own hands. This mind-bending collection of geometric origami includes twenty-seven inventive shapes, from simple one-piece pyramids to beautiful and intricate starbursts, each carefully designed and explained with illustrated step-by-step instructions. Also included are thirty-two sheets of origami paper to get you started.</p><p>Mark Bolitho has been involved with origami for thirty-five years and is the former chairman of the British Origami Society. Having worked for many years as an accountant, he now devotes his time to origami, from creating and authoring books and kits to undertaking commissions for large-scale exhibitions."Bolitho (The Origami Home) combines paper-folding and geometry in this collection that includes both one-piece and modular pieces in a variety of shapes. Items range from the classic four-pyramid fortune-teller popular among school-age children to complex, multisided shapes. The modular designs feature anywhere from two to 90 pieces.. Still, the models themselves are fascinating, and there's plenty here to appeal to both amateur and experienced paper artists. VERDICT The combination of thorough, helpful instruction, geometry, and one-piece and modular models will appeal to crafters interested in trying something different with origami." <br> - Library Journal</p><h2>DAILY VAGUS NERVE EXERCISE: A self-help guide to stimulate vagal tone, relieve anxiety and prevent inflammation</h2><p><p><b>Did you know you could access Vagus Nerve easily every day to improve your memories, decrease your anxiety and prevent inflammation?</b></p><i>Are you having anxiety or chronic stress, suffering from inflammation or experiencing difficulty to remember things sometimes? </i><br><b>You can improve all of them simply by activating this magical nerve in your body. </b><br>In today&#x2019;s fast-moving world, you get bombarded with daily anxiety that doesn&#x2019;t leave your head even during weekends.

It seemed to me then, when&nbsp;I stood in that desert fifteen years ago, as if I were&nbsp;an actress in a film about someone else&#x2019;s adventure.&nbsp;Not mine. Certainly it was not an adventure that a&nbsp;quiet girl from Indio, California, ever expected to&nbsp;live.&nbsp;<br><br>The lights of a passing car glimmer through my&nbsp;closed eyelids. When I open my eyes, Egypt vanishes.&nbsp;No longer am I standing in the desert gazing&nbsp;at a sky smeared by sunset the color of bruises. Instead&nbsp;I am once again half a world away, lying in&nbsp;my dark San Diego bedroom.&nbsp;<br><br>I climb out of bed and walk barefoot to the window&nbsp;to look out at the street. It is a tired neighborhood&nbsp;of stucco tract homes built in the 1950s, before&nbsp;the American dream meant mini-mansions and&nbsp;three- car garages. There is honesty in the modest&nbsp;but sturdy houses, built not to impress but to shelter,&nbsp;and I feel safely anonymous here. Just another&nbsp;single mother struggling to raise a recalcitrant&nbsp;teenage daughter.&nbsp;<br><br>Peeking through the curtains at the street, I see a&nbsp;dark- colored sedan slow down half a block away.&nbsp;It pulls over to the curb, and the headlights turn&nbsp;off. I watch, waiting for the driver to step out, but&nbsp;no one does. For a long time the driver sits there.&nbsp;Perhaps he&#x2019;s listening to the radio, or maybe he&#x2019;s&nbsp;had a fight with his wife and is afraid to face her.&nbsp;Perhaps there are lovers in that car with nowhere&nbsp;else to go. I can formulate so many explanations,&nbsp;none of them alarming, yet my skin is prickling with&nbsp;hot dread.&nbsp;<br><br>A moment later the sedan&#x2019;s taillights come back&nbsp;on, and the car pulls away and continues down the&nbsp;street.&nbsp;<br><br>Even after it vanishes around the corner, I am still&nbsp;jittery, clutching the curtains in my damp hand. I&nbsp;return to bed and lie sweating on top of the covers,&nbsp;but I cannot sleep. Although it&#x2019;s a warm July night,&nbsp;I keep my bedroom window latched, and insist that&nbsp;my daughter, Tari, keeps hers latched as well. But&nbsp;Tari does not always listen to me.&nbsp;<br><br>Every day, she listens to me less.<br><br>&nbsp;I close my eyes and, as always, the visions of Egypt&nbsp;come back. It&#x2019;s always to Egypt that my thoughts return.&nbsp;Even before I stood on its soil, I&#x2019;d dreamed&nbsp;about it. At six years old, I spotted a photograph of&nbsp;the Valley of the Kings on the cover of <i>National Geographic,&nbsp;</i>feeling instant recognition, as though I&nbsp;were looking at a familiar, much- beloved face that&nbsp;I had almost forgotten. That was what the land&nbsp;meant to me, a beloved face I longed to see again.&nbsp;And as the years progressed, I laid the foundations&nbsp;for my return. I worked and studied. A full scholarship&nbsp;brought me to Stanford, and to the attention&nbsp;of a professor who enthusiastically recommended&nbsp;me for a summer job at an excavation in Egypt&#x2019;s&nbsp;western desert.&nbsp;<br><br>In June, at the end of my ju nior year, I boarded a&nbsp;flight to Cairo.&nbsp;Even now, in the darkness of my California bedroom,&nbsp;I remember how my eyes ached from the&nbsp;sunlight glaring on white- hot sand. I smell the sunscreen&nbsp;on my skin and feel the sting of the wind&nbsp;peppering my face with desert grit. These memories&nbsp;make me happy. With a trowel in my hand and the&nbsp;sun on my shoulders, this was the culmination of a&nbsp;young girl&#x2019;s dreams.&nbsp;<br><br>How quickly dreams become nightmares. I&#x2019;d&nbsp;boarded the plane to Cairo as a happy college student.&nbsp;Three months later, I returned home a changed&nbsp;woman.&nbsp;<br><br>I did not come back from the desert alone. A&nbsp;monster followed me.&nbsp;<br><br>In the dark, my eyelids spring open. Was that a&nbsp;footfall? A door creaking open? I lie on damp&nbsp;sheets, heart battering itself against my chest. I am&nbsp;afraid to get out of bed, and afraid not to.&nbsp;<br><br>Something is not right in this house.&nbsp;<br><br>After years of hiding, I know better than to ignore&nbsp;the warning whispers in my head. Those urgent&nbsp;whispers are the only reason I am still alive. I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;learned to pay heed to every anomaly, every tremor&nbsp;of disquiet. I notice unfamiliar cars driving up my&nbsp;street. I snap to attention if a co- worker mentions&nbsp;that someone was asking about me. I make elaborate&nbsp;escape plans long before I ever need them. My&nbsp;next move is already planned out. In two hours, my&nbsp;daughter and I can be over the border and in Mexico&nbsp;with new identities. Our passports, with new&nbsp;names, are already tucked away in my suitcase.&nbsp;We should have left by now. We should not have&nbsp;waited this long.&nbsp;<br><br>But how do you convince a fourteen- year- old girl&nbsp;to move away from her friends? Tari is the problem;&nbsp;she does not understand the danger we&#x2019;re in.&nbsp;I pull open the nightstand drawer and take out the gun. It is not legally registered, and it makes me&nbsp;ner vous, keeping a firearm under the same roof with&nbsp;my daughter. But after six weekends at the shooting&nbsp;range, I know how to use it.&nbsp;<br><br>My bare feet are silent as I step out of my room&nbsp;and move down the hall, past my daughter&#x2019;s closed&nbsp;door. I conduct the same inspection that I have made&nbsp;a thousand times before, always in the dark. Like&nbsp;any prey, I feel safest in the dark.&nbsp;<br><br>In the kitchen, I check the windows and the door.&nbsp;In the living room, I do the same. Everything is secure.&nbsp;I come back up the hall and pause outside my&nbsp;daughter&#x2019;s bedroom. Tari has become fanatical&nbsp;about her privacy, but there is no lock on her door,&nbsp;and I will never allow there to be one. I need to be&nbsp;able to look in, to confirm that she is safe.&nbsp;<br><br>The door gives a loud squeak as I open it, but it&nbsp;won&#x2019;t wake her. As with most teenagers, her sleep is&nbsp;akin to a coma. The first thing I notice is the breeze,&nbsp;and I give a sigh. Once again, Tari has ignored my&nbsp;wishes and left her window wide open, as she has so&nbsp;many times before.&nbsp;<br><br>It feels like sacrilege, bringing the gun into my&nbsp;daughter&#x2019;s bedroom, but I need to close that window.&nbsp;I step inside and pause beside the bed, watching&nbsp;her sleep, listening to the steady rhythm of her&nbsp;breathing. I remember the first time I laid eyes on&nbsp;her, red- faced and crying in the obstetrician&#x2019;s&nbsp;hands. I had been in labor eigh teen hours, and was&nbsp;so exhausted I could barely lift my head from the&nbsp;pillow. But after one glimpse of my baby, I would&nbsp;have risen from bed and fought a legion of attackers&nbsp;to protect her. That was the moment I knew&nbsp;what her name would be. I thought of the words&nbsp;carved into the great temple at Abu Simbel, words&nbsp;chosen by Ramses the Great to proclaim his love for&nbsp;his wife.&nbsp;<br><br>Nefertari, for whom the sun doth shine&nbsp;<br><br>My daughter, Nefertari, is the one and only trea -&nbsp;sure that I brought back with me from Egypt. And&nbsp;I am terrified of losing her.&nbsp;<br><br>Tari is so much like me. It&#x2019;s as if I am watching&nbsp;myself sleeping. When she was ten years old, she&nbsp;could already read hieroglyphs. At twelve, she could&nbsp;recite all the dynasties down to the Ptolemys. She&nbsp;spends her weekends haunting the Museum of&nbsp;Man. She is a clone of me in every way, and as the&nbsp;years pass there is no obvious trace of her father in&nbsp;her face or her voice or, most important of all, her&nbsp;soul. She is my daughter, mine alone, untainted by&nbsp;the evil that fathered her.&nbsp;<br><br>But she is also a normal fourteen- year- old girl,&nbsp;and this has been a source of frustration these past&nbsp;weeks as I&#x2019;ve felt darkness closing in around us, as&nbsp;I lie awake every night, listening for a monster&#x2019;s&nbsp;footsteps. My daughter is oblivious to the danger&nbsp;because I have hidden the truth from her. I want&nbsp;her to grow up strong and fearless, a warrior&nbsp;woman who is unafraid of shadows. She does not&nbsp;understand why I pace the house late at night, why&nbsp;I latch the windows and double- check the doors.&nbsp;She thinks I am a worrywart, and it&#x2019;s true: I do all&nbsp;the worrying for both of us, to preserve the illusion&nbsp;that all is right with the world.&nbsp;<br><br>That is what Tari believes. She likes San Diego and&nbsp;she looks forward to her first year in high school.&nbsp;She&#x2019;s managed to make friends here, and heaven&nbsp;help the parent who tries to come between a teenager&nbsp;and her friends. She is as strong- willed as I am, and&nbsp;were it not for her re sis tance, we would have left&nbsp;town weeks ago.&nbsp;<br><br>A breeze blows in the window, chilling the sweat&nbsp;on my skin.&nbsp;<br><br>I set the gun down on the nightstand and cross&nbsp;to the window to close it. For a moment I linger,&nbsp;breathing in cool air. Outside, the night has fallen&nbsp;silent, except for a mosquito&#x2019;s whine. A prick stings&nbsp;my cheek. The significance of that mosquito bite&nbsp;does not strike me until I reach up to slide the window&nbsp;shut. I feel the icy breath of panic rush up my&nbsp;spine.&nbsp;<br><br>There is no screen over the window. <i>Where is the&nbsp;screen?&nbsp;</i><br><br>Only then do I sense the malevolent presence.&nbsp;While I stood lovingly watching my daughter, <i>it </i>was&nbsp;watching me. It has always been watching, biding&nbsp;its time, waiting for its chance to spring. Now it has&nbsp;found us.&nbsp;<br><br>I turn and face the evil.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><h2>The Little Fire Engine (Mr. Small Books)</h2><p>Mr. Small does it all (and now he does it in board books)!<br><br>In this adventure, Fireman Small rushes to battle a fire in town. When the alarm bell rings, Fireman Small suits up and roars down the road in his shiny red fire engine. When he helps extinguish the fire and rescues a young girl, Fireman Small becomes a hero in Tinytown.</p><p>Lois Lenski was the author and illustrator of more than 90 books for children, including the very popular &#34;Mr. Small&#34; picture books. She is counted among the most influential author-illustrators of the twentieth century. She was awarded the Newbery Medal for STRAWBERRY GIRL and a Newbery Honor for both INDIAN CAPTIVE and PHEBE FAIRCHILD.Reviewed with Lois Lenski's <i>The Little Train</i>.<p>PreS. These two new board books are based on Lenski's picture books with the same titles, originally published in the 1940s. In<i> Fire Engine</i>, Fireman Small drives his little fire engine to a house fire, where he rescues the inhabitants and douses the flames. In<i> Train</i>, Engineer Small drives his little passenger train from Tinytown through the countryside to Union Station. Some lines of the stories and illustrations have been omitted and other minor changes have been made in the these editions, but each book ends with one of the series' familiar tag lines, such as "<i>And that's all about Fireman Small!</i>" The colorful, childlike pictures have definite appeal for the very young. Although the text is a bit long for many babies and toddlers, these colorful board books might still hold the interest of avid train and fire engine enthusiasts. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His work promises to be an excellent educational guide for those interested in paleontology or seeking information about their fortuitous discovery of fossil remains."--James S. Dunbar, archaeological field supervisor, Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research</p><p>With boundless enthusiasm, Mark Renz stumbles onto the skeletal remains of fierce saber-toothed cats, gentle sea cows, massive mammoths and mastodons, Volkswagen-size armadillos, and an ancient 5-ton giant ground sloth, and then shares these experiences in a humorous, illustrated book for beginning fossil collectors.<br>&nbsp;<br>Want to look for fossils yourself but not sure how to get started? Renz tells how and where to hunt and how to preserve your finds for another million years, and he provides more than 250 photographs that help you to identify those bones and teeth and distinguish a prehistoric bison from a farmer's lost cow. He also provides information about what&#x2019;s there to be found, the hurdles and hazards to be overcome, and the legalities to be observed. Guided by an appreciation for the professional paleontologist and also for the laws that regulate his hobby, Renz explains, for example, why it is okay to dig for fossils in a state-owned creek bed (providing one possesses a state permit and does not dig in a state park), and why it is illegal to engage in the same activity in search of artifacts.<br><br>With writing that's free of technical jargon but full of love for fossiling, this illustrated book will inspire you to explore the huge number of rich fossil deposits in Florida that can be found with just a shovel and a keen eye.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Renz</b>, writer and amateur paleontologist, has taught continuing education classes geared for beginner fossil collectors at Edison Community College in Fort Myers and leads fossil-finding expeditions in southwest Florida.

I smile. &#x201c;At least I don&#x2019;t have toothpaste on my face.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jaxon makes no attempt to check if I&#x2019;m right; he just chews away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sam and Jax--Monday-morning match: round one,&#x201d; my dad says, pouring a second cup of coffee into his #1 dad mug and looking at Mrs. Meriwether. &#x201c;I think there&#x2019;s a frightening possibility that our children take after us, Mae. Neighbors, best friends, surly dispositions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Meriwether pats the corners of her mouth with a white cloth napkin. &#x201c;The way I remember it, I was mostly an angel. It was your mother who had to threaten you with weeding the garden for a month just to keep your slingshot on your lap and off her table,&#x201d; she says.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad smiles at her, and I stop chewing. His time in a coma felt like an endless walk down a dark tunnel. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll eventually get used to him just sitting here drinking coffee and smiling. But for these past six months, every minute I&#x2019;ve spent with him still feels like borrowed time.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad&#x2019;s eyes twinkle with mischief. &#x201c;Now, we all know it was your slingshot.

I whip around in my chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> A girl about ten years old stands a couple of feet away from me in an old-fashioned pink dress. Her brown hair is braided and tied with ribbons. She giggles, scrunching her dark eyes and small nose together as the blueberry sticks to Jaxon&#x2019;s cheek. No one else is laughing but her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jaxon wipes his face and stares at me without looking in the girl&#x2019;s direction. My skin goes cold. He doesn&#x2019;t see her. I shut my eyes for a long second and take a breath, turning back to the table and away from the girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jaxon, Mrs. Meriwether, and my dad all watch me with matching worried expressions.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is everything okay?&#x201d; Mrs. Meriwether asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> My hands shake, and I put them under the table. &#x201c;Um, yeah.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you sure, Sam? You look spooked,&#x201d; my dad says, all his good humor replaced with concern.<br> &nbsp;<br> I glance behind me; the girl&#x2019;s gone. My shoulders drop an inch. &#x201c;I thought I heard something.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad frowns. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; We&#x2019;ve only talked once about what happened while he was in a coma. And I only told him selective pieces. How Vivian sold our New York City apartment and lied about his medical bills. How when I found out she was lying, she threatened my friends to manipulate me. How when she realized I wouldn&#x2019;t do what she wanted, she tried to kill us with spells. And how those spells backfired on her. Mostly, he just listened with his eyebrows pushed forcefully together. When I finished, he had tears in his eyes. He told me to get some sleep, and he kissed me on the forehead. He doesn&#x2019;t know how many people she killed. And I left out all the magical elements I could. Every time I said &#x201c;spell,&#x201d; he flinched like someone had burned him. There was so much guilt on his face that I hated telling him even the pared-down version. He hasn&#x2019;t brought it up since. And I&#x2019;m grateful, because I can&#x2019;t stand being reminded that I lied to him. That was the first time I ever did.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just a noise,&#x201d; I say, and look down at my plate. A second lie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A ghost noise or a people noise?&#x201d; Mrs. Meriwether asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad stiffens at the word &#x201c;ghost.&#x201d; Mrs. Meriwether and Jaxon know I saw Elijah, but he&#x2019;s one of those details I never mentioned to my dad. How would I even start? Hey, Dad. I fell in love with this dead guy from the sixteen hundreds who was stubborn and beautiful. And then he disappeared and I had a crap time getting over him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Maybe I imagined it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Meriwether turns to my dad. &#x201c;I really think she needs some training, Charlie. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s just a loosey-goosey free-for-all. What happens when she learns to drive? What if a ghost appears in the seat next to her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sit straight up, every muscle in my body ready to run away from this conversation. Did Mrs. Meriwether tell my dad about me seeing Elijah? Or did he hear the rumors in town? How could I be so stupid to think this would all just go away?<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad stares at me with such seriousness that everyone gets quiet, waiting on his reaction. &#x201c;Sam, did you see something just now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say, doing my best to keep my anxiety out of my voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad&#x2019;s home from the hospital, the kids in school don&#x2019;t hate me, and with Vivian gone, my bad luck has basically vanished. Vivian. My stomach tenses. All I want is for things to stay normal; I&#x2019;m happy for the first time in a long time.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad looks from Mrs. Meriwether to me. &#x201c;Then why is Mae worried about a ghost appearing in your passenger seat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I push my plate away, avoiding the matching sympathetic looks from the Meriwethers. The words don&#x2019;t want to leave my mouth. &#x201c;I saw a spirit during the whole thing that happened last fall.&#x201d; My cheeks redden. &#x201c;But I haven&#x2019;t seen one since.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not seeing spirits again. I won&#x2019;t. Elijah was different. He . . . he was just different.<br> &nbsp;<br> The corners of my dad&#x2019;s eyes wrinkle as he narrows them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Be sure to let us know if you do,&#x201d; Mrs. Meriwether says. &#x201c;The last time you saw a ghost, a whole set of unfortunate circumstances followed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My eyes meet hers. Is she saying that seeing a spirit is a bad omen?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No more talk of . . . no more talk of training, Mae. She&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; my dad says with such finality that Mrs. Meriwether raises a questioning eyebrow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna go get dressed,&#x201d; Jaxon says, sounding almost as uncomfortable as I feel and sliding his chair away from the table.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; I say with a grumble.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad leans back in his chair, and the tension rolls off him. &#x201c;Aaah. Now, there&#x2019;s the cranky morning Sam I know and love.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I pause, soaking up his dad humor. He&#x2019;s said some version of this to me since I was little. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that. I can&#x2019;t make anyone believe I&#x2019;m angsty if I&#x2019;m smiling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We share a smile, and I can tell he&#x2019;s relieved to have changed the subject.<br> &nbsp;<br> I push back my chair, but what I really want to push away is Mrs. Meriwether&#x2019;s comment about the last time a spirit showed up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Night Sister</h2><p><b>From the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jennifer McMahon (<i>The Winter People</i>) comes an atmospheric, gripping, and suspenseful tale that probes the bond between sisters and the peril of keeping secrets.</b><br><br>The Tower Motel was once a thriving attraction of rural Vermont.&nbsp;Today it lies in disrepair, alive only in the memories of the three women&#x2014;Amy, Piper, and Piper&#x2019;s kid sister, Margot&#x2014;who played there as children. They loved exploring the abandoned rooms ... until the day their innocent games uncovered something dark and twisted that ruined their friendship forever. <br><br>Now, Amy stands accused of committing a horrific crime, and the only hint to her motives is a hasty message that forces Piper and Margot to revisit the motel&#x2019;s past, and the fate of two sisters who lived there in its heyday. &nbsp;Sylvie Slater had dreams of running off to Hollywood and becoming Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s leading lady, while her little sister, Rose, was content with their simple life. Each believed the other to be something truly monstrous, but only one knows the secret that will haunt the generations to come.</p><p>JENNIFER McMAHON is the author of six novels, including the<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-sellers<i>&nbsp;Promise Not to Tell</i>&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;The Winter People</i>. She graduated from Goddard College and studied poetry in the MFA Writing Program at Vermont College.&nbsp;<br><b>Amy&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Amy&#x2019;s heart hammers, and her skin is slick with sweat. <br><br><i>Focus</i>, she tells herself.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Don&#x2019;t think about the thing in the tower.</i>&nbsp; <br><br>Amy knows that if she thinks too hard about it, she won&#x2019;t be able to do what needs to be done.&nbsp;<br><br>She looks down at the photo, the old black-and-white print she&#x2019;s kept for almost thirty years, hidden away in the drawer of her bedside table.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s been handled so much that it&#x2019;s cracked and faded, one of the corners torn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In it, her mother, Rose, and her Aunt Sylvie are young girls, wearing crisp summer dresses as they stand in front of a sign that says <i>World Famous London Chicken Circus</i>.&nbsp; Each girl clutches a worried-looking hen, but that&#x2019;s where the similarities end. Amy&#x2019;s mother is wearing a scowl beneath tired eyes, her hair dark and unkempt, while Sylvie is radiant, the one who was going to grow up and go to Hollywood. Her blond hair is movie-star perfect, her eyes shining. <br><br>Someone had scrawled a date on the back: June, 1955. If only Amy could travel back in time, talk to those two girls, warn them what was coming.&nbsp; Warn them that one day, it would all lead to this moment: Amy alone and out of options, on the verge of doing something terrible. <br><br>She bites her lip and wonders what people will say about her once she&#x2019;s gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>That she was broken inside, a woman with a screw loose (Aren&#x2019;t all women like that, really?&nbsp; Little time bombs waiting? Especially women like her&#x2014;surviving on monthly boxes from the food pantry, dressing her children in ragged, second-hand clothes that never quite fit.)&nbsp; <br><br><i>What went wrong</i>? they will whisper to each other while fondling artichokes and avocados in the produce aisle of the grocery store.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>What kind of monster was she</i>? they might ask after a few glasses of wine as they sit in tidy living rooms, gathered for book club.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But these people know nothing of true monsters.&nbsp; They will never have to make the choices Amy has made.<br><br>The fluorescent lights in the kitchen buzz and flicker.&nbsp; Amy takes a deep breath, looks out the kitchen window. Beyond the gravel driveway, past the two ruined motel buildings with their sagging, swaybacked roofs, the tower leans precariously.&nbsp; Made of cement and stone, it was built by her grandfather all those years ago as a gift for her grandmother Charlotte.&nbsp; Her own Tower of London.<br><br>Amy thinks, as she often does, of that long ago summer when she was twelve.&nbsp; Of Piper and Margot and the day they found the suitcase; of how after that, nothing was ever the same.&nbsp; <br><br>Where was Piper now?&nbsp; Out in California somewhere, surrounded by palm trees and glamorous people, living a life Amy couldn&#x2019;t even imagine.&nbsp; Amy suddenly longs to talk to her, to confide in her and ask for forgiveness, to say, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see this is what I have to do?&#x201d; <br><br>She thinks that Piper and Margot might understand if she could tell them the whole story, starting with the suitcase and working forward. <br><br>But mostly, what she wishes, is that she could find a way to warn them.&nbsp;<br><br>She glances at the old photo in her hand, takes a black marker from a kitchen drawer, and hastily writes a message along the bottom, over the chickens and patterned summer dresses. Then she tucks the photograph into her back pocket and goes to the window.<br><br>The clock on the stove says 12:15 am.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Down at the tower, a shadow lurches from the open doorway.&nbsp; <br><br>She&#x2019;s out of time.&nbsp;<br><br>Moving into the hallway, she latches the deadbolt on the front door (silly, really&#x2014;a locked door will do no good), then stops at the closet and grabs her grandfather&#x2019;s old Winchester.&nbsp; Rifle in hand, she climbs the stairs, the same stairs she&#x2019;s climbed her whole life.&nbsp; She thinks she can hear young Piper and Margot following behind her, whispering, warning her, telling her&#x2014;as they did all those years ago&#x2014;to forget all about it, that there is no 29th room.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Amy takes each step slowly, willing herself not to run, to stay calm and not wake her family.&nbsp; What would Mark think if he woke up and found his wife creeping up the steps with a gun?&nbsp; Poor, sweet, clueless Mark&#x2014;perhaps she should have told him the motel&#x2019;s secrets?&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; It was better to protect him from it all as best she could. <br><br>The scarred wood beneath her feet creaks and she thinks of the rhyme her grandmother taught her:&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><i>When Death comes knocking on your door, you&#x2019;ll think you&#x2019;ve seen his face before.</i><br><i>When he comes creeping up your stairs, you&#x2019;ll know him from your dark nightmares.</i><br><i>And if you hold up a mirror, you shall see,</i><br><i>That he is you and you are he.</i></p><h2>Measure For Measure: Third Series (The Arden Shakespeare Third Series)</h2><p><p>Often described as one of Shakespeare's 'problem plays', <i>Measure for Measure </i>explores issues of mercy and justice in corrupt Vienna.

The writings are remarkably direct and freshly true. As Atul Gawande notes, &#x201c;Reading these tales,you find yourself in a conversation with Williams about who people really are&#x2015;who you really are. Williams recognized that, caring for the people of his city, he had a front-row seat to the human condition. His writing makes us see it and hear it and grapple with it in all its complexities. That is his lasting gift.&#x201d;</p><p><p>Besides being a practicing physician, <strong>William Carlos Williams</strong> (1883&#x2013;1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist, translator, playwright, and essayist whose contribution to the development of modern American poetry grew out of his commitment to recording the "local" experience of Rutherford, New Jersey, and its environs.</p><p>The surgeon and public health leader <strong>Dr. Atul Gawande</strong> is a MacArthur Fellow and a staff writer for the&nbsp;New Yorker&nbsp;and has written four&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;best sellers.&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;Williams&#x2019; shockingly vivid portraits of bigotry and bias ultimately serve to expose the normally opaque medical practitioner, examining the examiner where his flaws are most flagrant...The collection moves like a surgeon: It makes you uncomfortable and looks at you naked.

The Founding Fathers didn't want any of this. In fact, they said so quite clearly in the Constitution of the United States of America. Unfortunately, that beautiful, ingenious, and revolutionary document is being ignored more and more in Washington. If we are to enjoy peace, freedom, and prosperity once again, we absolutely must return to the principles upon which America was founded. But finally, there is hope . . . <br><br>In THE REVOLUTION,<i> </i>Texas congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul has exposed the core truths behind everything threatening America, from the <i>real </i>reasons behind the collapse of the dollar and the looming financial crisis, to terrorism and the loss of our precious civil liberties. In this book, Ron Paul provides answers to questions that few even dare to ask. <br><br>Despite a media blackout, this septuagenarian physician-turned-congressman sparked a movement that has attracted a legion of young, dedicated, enthusiastic supporters . . . a phenomenon that has amazed veteran political observers and made more than one political rival envious. Candidates across America are already running as "Ron Paul Republicans."<br><br>"Dr. Paul cured my apathy," says a popular campaign sign. THE REVOLUTION may cure yours as well.</p><p>Ron Paul, an eleven-term congressman from Texas, is the leading advocate of freedom in our nation's capital. He has devoted his political career to the defense of individual liberty, sound money, and a non-interventionist foreign policy. Judge Andrew Napolitano calls him "the Thomas Jefferson of our day."<br><br>After serving as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s, Dr. Paul moved to Texas to begin a civilian medical practice, delivering over four thousand babies in his career as an obstetrician. He served in Congress from 1976 to 1984, and again from 1996 to the present. He and Carol Paul, his wife of fifty-one years, have five children, eighteen grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.<br><br>Ron Paul, the <i>New York Post</i> once wrote, is a politician who "cannot be bought by special interests."In 1988, while remaining a Republican, Texas Congressman Ron Paul ran for president as the nominee of the Libertarian Party. In 2008 he ran in the Republican primary, arousing a lot of interest but losing to John McCain. In this book he argues that if the United States continues exercising extra-constitutional foreign and domestic policies, we will suffer bankruptcy and possible social collapse. Bob Craig is a convincing, low-key narrator for this sort of thing. His mature, low baritone is articulate, gentle, persuasive, calm, and orderly. There is intensity, but it&#39;s mostly in the writing, and even then the combination of author and narrator is soothing, rather than exciting. No rabble-rousing here, just rational common sense.

What does the turkey we eat on Thanksgiving have to do with the country on the eastern Mediterranean? Can you figure out how much your dinner will cost by counting the words on the menu? <p>In <em>The Language of Food</em>, Stanford University professor and MacArthur Fellow Dan Jurafsky peels away the mysteries from the foods we think we know. Thirteen chapters evoke the joy and discovery of reading a menu dotted with the sharp-eyed annotations of a linguist. Jurafsky points out the subtle meanings hidden in filler words like "rich" and "crispy," zeroes in on the metaphors and storytelling tropes we rely on in restaurant reviews, and charts a microuniverse of marketing language on the back of a bag of potato chips.</p><p>The fascinating journey through <em>The Language of Food</em> uncovers a global atlas of culinary influences. With Jurafsky's insight, words like ketchup, macaron, and even salad become living fossils that contain the patterns of early global exploration that predate our modern fusion-filled world. From ancient recipes preserved in Sumerian song lyrics to colonial shipping routes that first connected East and West, Jurafsky paints a vibrant portrait of how our foods developed. A surprising history of culinary exchange&#x2015;a sharing of ideas and culture as much as ingredients and flavors&#x2015;lies just beneath the surface of our daily snacks, soups, and suppers.</p><p>Engaging and informed, Jurafsky's unique study illuminates an extraordinary network of language, history, and food. The menu is yours to enjoy.</p> 30 illustrations</p><p>Dan Jurafsky, a recipient of a MacArthur &#34;Genius Grant,&#34; is professor and chair of linguistics and professor of computer science at Stanford University. He and his wife live in San Francisco.&#x201c;[Jurafsky's] brilliant achievement is to weave together the journey food makes through culture with the journey its name makes through language.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Sokolowski, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Writing with knowledge and wit, Dan Jurafsky shows that the language of food reflects our desires and aspirations, whether it&#x2019;s on a fancy French menu or a bag of potato chips.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bee Wilson, author of <em>Consider the Fork: A History of How We Cook and Eat</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dan Jurafsky has taken on the subject with scholarship, wit, and charm, making <em>The Language of Food</em> a very engaging book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Kurlansky, author of <em>Cod</em> and <em>Paper</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mix equal parts fascinating history, surprising etymology, and brilliant linguistic analysis, add a generous dollop of humor, and savor <em>The Language of Food</em>.

Cornelius Van Til, who taught for more than forty-five years at Westminster Seminary, sometimes used philosophical vocabulary in "The Defense," and many of his conversation partners and critics were not widely known. When later editions greatly abridged this work for these reasons, valuable discussions were laid aside.<br><br>Now they are restored, and with added clarification. Newly edited and retypeset, this unabridged edition features a foreword and explanatory notes by K. Scott Oliphint, which help us grasp a method of apologetics consistent with the nature of Christianity itself and continually relevant to our time.</p><p>K. Scott Oliphint is Professor of Apologetics and Systematic Theology at Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has degrees from West Texas State University and Westminster Theological Seminary."This new edition provides an enormous service to the reader. The somewhat challenging text is abundantly illuminated by Scott Oliphint, no doubt the leading expert on Van Til in our times." --William Edgar<br><br>"Though Van Til often engages ideas, terms, and conversation partners unknown to contemporary readers, this work has a delightful effect in exposing the pretensions of human autonomy and the grandeur of God's sovereign grace. In his careful, thorough, and sympathetic notes, Professor Oliphint has done us all a tremendous service." --Michael S. Horton<br><br>"The original is back, with Scott Oliphint's excellent foreword and explanatory footnotes. Now Van Til is much more understandable, and his opponents too. How stimulating it must have been to be part of that dialogue in the early days of Reformed apologetics! We need that stimulus now if we are to deal with unbelief in a God-honoring way." --John M. Frame</p><h2>The Theory of the Leisure Class (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>In his scathing <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em>, Thorstein Veblen produced a landmark study of affluent American society that exposes, with brilliant ruthlessness, the habits of production and waste that link invidious business tactics and barbaric social behavior. Veblen's analysis of the evolutionary process sees greed as the overriding motive in the modern economy, and with an impartial gaze he examines the human cost paid when social institutions exploit the consumption of unessential goods for the sake of personal profit. Fashion, beauty, animals, sports, the home, the clergy, scholars--all are assessed for their true usefulness and found wanting. Indeed, Veblen's critique covers all aspects of modern life from dress, class, the position of women, home decoration, industry, business, and sport, to religion, scholarship, and education. The targets of Veblen's coruscating satire are as evident today as they were a century ago, and his book still has the power to shock and enlighten. Martha Banta's introduction illuminates Veblen's uncompromising arguments as it highlights the literary force of Veblen's writing and its influence on later American writers such as Edith Wharton, Henry James, Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. She also sheds light on his critique of the plight of women and his evolutionary arguments as they relate to modern society.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Drawing information from 10 years of investigative journalism, Liam invites you to join the hunt for the details that lie just beneath the surface. In this heavily-researched but irreverent book, we&#39;ll look under the rocks and stones of our culture: From CIA and JFK, to 9/11 and Shakespeare; from Vaccination to HIV to Big Bang theory, Darwinism, Plate Tectonics and more. Think of it as a corrective textbook to all the tales we were taught in school. Why do we accept some stories as true when the details so obviously contradict the headlines? We&#39;re going to find out what&#39;s real, what&#39;s true, and what&#39;s just an &#34;official story.&#34;</p><p>Liam Scheff is an investigative journalist, radio host and stand-up lecturer on the contemporary myths of sex, religion, science, politics and culture.

The book has a tasty entertaining appeal which is only exceeded by it's stunning educational value. The awareness and realization that the reader will inevitably reach as they devour and digest the material would leave most uninitiated among us disturbed. The facetious and humorous undertones in which the information is presented however, allows the reader to absorb the truth and assimilate the information in a manner that turns a necessary but undesirable consumable into a delicious entree' leaving you wanting a second serving. I personally believe that every high school student should be required to read this book before they graduate so that future generations can learn from the mistakes we've made and remain vigilant to prevent the same from occurring yet again. I can't recommend this book enough!" - Dr. Rashid A. Buttar, FAAPM, FACAM, FAAIM, Medical Director, Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research, International Best Selling Author of "The 9 Steps to Keep the Doctor Away"<br><br>"The book is dynamite. I read Chapter 6 line by line, step by step, without once getting up. Riveting, funny, farcical, eye-opening and long overdue! It's a superb summation, combining the rage and fury the subject deserves, along with a steely sharp sense of wit and understatement that pillories and harpoons the squalid clique of AIDS racketeers we have come to know and loathe...Liam has wonderfully exquisite sense of irony and understatement akin to that Jimmy Kimmel and Dennis Miller." - Dr. Charles Geshekter, Emeritus Professor of African History, California State University/Chico<br><br>"Liam explains key moments in our history and present crisis. Like a wise, friendly and charming uncle, he strolls into our living rooms and begins chatting in an easy unassuming manner. No question, we understand exactly what he's talking about. It's clear, it's vivid, it's fascinating---and then all of a sudden, we're dropping down through space, down through a deep rabbit hole into the Truth, which is to say, the scams and cons and cover-ups and lies we've been fed about reality. He's giving us the precise details and weaving them together, still in that folksy way, and his story, we realize, is just the kind of reporting we've always wanted, tearing the lid off the mysteries...and it's too late to turn back...we're hooked, and we want to be hooked." - Jon Rappoport, Author and Editor, The Matrix Revealed<br><br>"Few explanatory journalists think or write like Liam Scheff. That's too bad. The Progressive Era's crusade to replace a partisan press with theoretically truth-vetted journalism was noble, but mis-guided. Progressives replaced tainted partisanship with faith-based reliance on oxymoronic social science "expertise" and with rule books interpreted by unaccountable bureaucrats--culprits who tell those Official Stories. Their tales are often convenient lies to mask ignorance, fear and greed, to cover the asses of officials who tell them. But these official versions are used also by "objective" journalists to cover their own rear ends, to get stories past editors by quoting authorities instead of doing their own research. Liam Scheff debunks official lies about things like "HIV" and "AIDS" with simple, research-informed language, proving you don't need advanced degree or keys to temples jealously guarded by the new Science and Medicine gods, who have replaced priests and princes as enforcers of Truth. Scheff writes with revealing and entertaining satire. His is a work I'll recommend to the future political reporters I try to teach about the increased politicizing - and corruption - of science and medicine." - Terry Michael, Director, Washington Center for Politics &amp; Journalism<br><br>"Have you ever wondered why so many big events in history seem to have been (conveniently) perpetrated by one lone gunman - who often ends up dead? If so, Official Stories is the book for you. Liam Scheff asks big questions and then digs, digs, and digs to find answers the corporate and state media would never dare to report. If you are ready to lift the veil, read this book." - Leslie Manookian, Writer/Producer, "The Greater Good" vaccine documentary.<br><br>"What a powerful, hilarious and sometimes infuriating book Liam Scheff has written. It delivers like fireworks on the fourth of July and has more unexpected turns than a presidential motorcade driving down Houston Street. There are several books available that go into the JFK assassination, conspiracy, 9/11, vaccination, AIDS, and even Shakespeare but there's nothing, absolutely nothing like this!The chapters are threaded together in a very readable and entertaining way, the common players present in each one: the Lone Gunman, the Magic Bullet and of course, the Official story. Having a vaccine injured child, I've been researching vaccines for nearly 4 years and have never come across anything that delivers like this. I want everyone to read it. It really is that good." - April Boden - Writer, Activist and Mother of vaccine injured child; "AydansRecovery. blogspot.com"<br><br>"Liam Scheff brings you a version of the Kennedy assassination like a punch to the gut. Candid, concise and hard-hitting." - Jim Marrs, Author/Investigator of "Crossfire" and "The Trillion Dollar Conspiracy"<br><br>"For those who dare to venture there, way out behind the bleachers of argumentum ad populum, sits Liam Scheff, penning essays atop the grassy knoll of truth. "Official Stories" is more than a swift stick to beat down the lurking snakes and scoundrels meant to discourage your trek to enlightenment, this book is a bright light on the darkened myths we were brought up with in the old Republic. This is the wake-up call we've been waiting for." - Jeff Ogrisseg, Journalist, Tokyo<br><br>"After suffering 24 years of ill health, I learned that the official stories told to me about modern medicine were lies. Natural medicines unapproved by government healed me despite what I was told by the experts. From that moment on, I wondered what other things I had been taught to believe were true were merely stories to benefit the purveyors of the official stories. It turns out, there are a lot of other stories, official, yet untrue. Liam Scheff has captured and revealed many of them in one book unlike any I have ever read. Hook, line and sinker, each chapter reveals the official story, smoking gun and then scratches until the fallacy beneath its thin, yet often overwhelming veneer, is revealed. Good luck putting this book down, because with each chapter you will want to know about the next official story - now! It's brilliant, and it's about time." - Robert Scott Bell, Homeopath and National Radio Host<br><br>"It is often said, "exceptional claims require exceptional proof." But history shows otherwise that entrenched paradigms survive exceptional disproof for centuries. For example, if subjected to cross-examination, big bang cosmology would fail as abjectly as traditional creation stories to explain the universe. But the beliefs of religion and science are equally sacrosanct. They are not subject to investigative journalism. Liam Scheff in 'Official Stories' meets this vital need by challenging our beliefs in science with logic, common sense and humor." - Wal Thornhill, Physicist, Co-Founder of Thunderbolts.info, Co-Author, "The Electric Universe" and "Thunderbolts of the Gods."</p><h2>Amma, Tell Me About Diwali!

Lamenting the vacuous, often pagan nature of contemporary American spirituality, Eugene Peterson here firmly grounds spirituality once more in Trinitarian theology and offers a clear, practical statement of what it means to actually <i>live out</i> the Christian life.<br><br>Writing in the conversational style that he is well known for, Peterson boldly sweeps out the misunderstandings that clutter conversations on spiritual theology and refurnishes the subject only with what is essential. As Peterson shows, spiritual theology, in order to be at once biblical and meaningful, must remain sensitive to ordinary life, present the Christian gospel, follow the narrative of Scripture, and be rooted in the "fear of the Lord" -- in short, spiritual theology must be about <i>God</i> and not about <i>us.</i><br><br>The foundational book in a five-volume series on spiritual theology emerging from Peterson's pen, <i>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</i> provides the conceptual and directional help we all need to live the Christian gospel well and maturely in the conditions that prevail in the church and world today.</p><p>Eugene H. Peterson was a longtime pastor and is professor emeritus of spiritual theology at Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia. His many other acclaimed books include Tell It Slant, The Jesus Way, Eat This Book, and the contemporary translation of the Bible titled The Message.,<b>Logos Bookstores</b>,&nbsp;<i>Best Theology/Doctrine/Reference Book</i>&nbsp;(2005)<br><b>Academy of Parish Clergy</b>,&nbsp;<i>Top Ten Books of the Year</i>&nbsp;(2006)<br><b>Christianity Today</b>,&nbsp;<i>Winner, Spirituality</i>&nbsp;(2006)<br><br><b><i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i></b><br> "Any one of his latest three books is well worth its while, but&nbsp;<i>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</i>, the largest at more than 300 pages, is notable for what it undertakes: a bringing together of biblical theology with lived spiritual life."<br><br><b><i>Pro Ecclesia</i></b><br> "Marked by intellectual and spiritual maturity, by an author moving sure-footedly through demanding terrain, discerning where the dangers lie and guiding us around them."<br><br><b><i>Christianity Today</i></b><br> "A tour de force in spiritual theology, combining incisive cultural analysis and biblical exposition with a sweeping and engaging vision of the Christian life."<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;Starred Review</b><br> "Rich, generous, and wise, Peterson's 'conversation' will help readers at every stage of faith to live their faith more deeply."<br><br><b><i>The Living Church</i></b><br> "Peterson describes his book as a conversation. It is, above all, a conversation among biblical texts. Through clear language, he shines new and welcome light on numerous connections within the Bible."<br><br><b><i>The Christian Century</i></b><br> "Eugene Peterson keeps surprising us. It is hard to imagine where he will go next with his spiritual theology. . . His pen hugely blesses the church."<br><br><b><i>Christian Scholar's Review</i></b><br> "<i>Christ Plays</i>&nbsp;invites consideration, not as a text to be categorized, but as a discourse to be imitated. . . [Peterson] habitually counters spiritual reductionisms by calling his readers to historic Christian practices."<br><br><b><i>Circuit Rider</i></b><br> "Peterson knows intimately the rhythms of the local parish; possessing a background in biblical languages, he also writes with depth and passion about the scriptures and their connection to the human condition. This lifelong pastoral vocation, deepened with a sustained attention to translating the scriptures, has come to fruition in a marvelous new book:&nbsp;<i>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</i>. . . Peterson is biblically coherent, culturally relevant, spiritually engaging. He is orthodox without being narrow-minded, critical without being dismissive, pastoral without being sentimental, evangelical without being joyless, scholarly without being pedantic. His style is conversational, and yet his subject matter is of utmost importance."<br><br><b><i>Enrichment</i></b><br> "Explores a biblical spirituality that works in the ordinariness of life while exposing the shallowness of contemporary Christianity. What artists do with color and sculptors do with texture and dimensionality, Peterson does brilliantly with language."<br><br><b>M. Craig Barnes</b><br> "<i>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</i>&nbsp;is the pivotal work on spiritual theology we have been waiting for. Eugene Peterson allows classical theology to make its own claims for contemporary spirituality. His particular genius is to reveal these insights by peering beneath the surface to speak of deeper, eternal truths for the soul as well as the mind."<br><br><b>Marva J. Dawn</b><br> "There is no pastor in the world that I trust more than Eugene Peterson, and this book offers us Eugene at his best &#x2014; poet, storyteller, wonderer, biblical scholar, sage, practiced disciple, and lover of God. He woos us into exquisitely perceptive Bible readings, diagnoses the dangers of our common shortcuts, and immerses us in the community of those who live the truth of the Trinity in Jesus' way. This is a life-transforming and liberating book. I pray that many people will give it thoughtful, reverent attention."<br><br><b>Frederick Dale Bruner</b><br> "What would a spiritual theology look like that came from the hands of a person who, after a long and faithful pastorate crowned by a remarkably fruitful professorate, had been immersed in translating the whole of Holy Scripture? It would look like Eugene Peterson's&nbsp;<i>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</i>. Completely free of gimmicks and cheap techniques, this book settles in convincingly at the center &#x2014; in the God-honoring Sabbath of creation, the Christ-centered supper of salvation, and the Spirit-honoring meals of community building and evangelism. I believe this is the deepest meditation on spiritual theology in our time."<br><br><b>Timothy L. Brown</b><br> "In 1987 Eugene Peterson saved my pastoral soul. He did it with the ancient wisdom of&nbsp;<i>Working the Angles</i>. He is at it again with&nbsp;<i>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places.</i>&nbsp;Everything I know and love about Peterson, personally and vocationally, stands skyscraper tall on the pages of this book. His life and his obedience are as tight as a lug nut on a fire hydrant. Here is a single-minded book for the pastor trying to shepherd the flock through the hill country of postmodern moral multiple choice. Here is a book for the scholar and teacher trying to find a sane way to rejoin the severed body parts of theology and practice. Here is a book for thinking Christian believers who know, if only intuitively, that all the religious self-help books in the world will never help us to 'play Christ' in that world 'in ten thousand places'!"<br><br><b>Anne Svennungsen</b><br> "How refreshing! A spiritual theology that begins and ends with God &#x2014; God's initiative, God's action in daily life, God's grace. Peterson is at his finest here, offering profound biblical and theological insight with the eloquence of a poet. Each page left me thirsty for more &#x2014; even as I found remarkable refreshment in these deep waters of wisdom and faith."<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br> &#x201c;In this first and foundational volume of a five-volume series, Peterson rescues <i>spirituality</i> from both its ancient connotations of cloistered monasticism and its modern contamination with self-help boosterism and neopagan recreation. . . .

And while you may not want some crazy medium telling you how to go about your business, you need to at least hear me out. Fair enough?<br> <br>But before we go there, I want to tell you a little about myself, in case you don&#x2019;t watch my reality show, Long Island Medium, haven&#x2019;t been to one of my live experiences, or didn&#x2019;t read my first book, There&#x2019;s More to Life Than This. Who knows? Maybe you bought this on a lark because you liked the cover. Maybe you thought, I like this woman&#x2019;s style. All that lilac and bling speak to me. . . . If so, me too! We already have that in common! See, this is going to be fun.<br> <br>So, I&#x2019;ve been sensing and feeling Spirit since a young age, which at the time included my guides and the souls of dead people like my great-grandmother, who I&#x2019;d never met. As a child, I actually thought it was normal to see figures at the foot of my bed or hear voices when I was the only person in the room. Even so, it bugged me out. I had night terrors that caused me to scream like mad when I sensed Spirit&#x2019;s energy, and as I grew up, I often felt stressed and strange in my body. To cope, I taught myself to mostly suppress what I was experiencing. A boatload of phobias kicked in after that, and my nervousness escalated, so by the time I met my husband, Larry, I was a real mess. I had debilitating anxiety that crept into every part of my life&#x2014;my marriage, friendships, and downtime that was supposed to be relaxing, like when I went on vacation or tried watching a movie. I couldn&#x2019;t do a lot of everyday activities without panicking, like drive in the rain or go to a birthday party. I constantly feared something bad would happen. It was a frightening and sometimes embarrassing way to live.<br> <br>After many, many years of trying to manage my feelings on my own and with a therapist&#x2014;and not making much progress&#x2014;my mom&#x2019;s friend Pat Longo, who&#x2019;s a spiritual healer and teacher, put me on the road to resolving my issues. After just one session, she explained, as if it were the most typical thing in the world, that the anxiety I felt was related to the fact that I&#x2019;m a medium and was suppressing Spirit&#x2019;s energy. Can you imagine? The least reassuring news you can give an anxious person is that dead people are drawn to them! But lo and behold, Pat was right.<br> <br>I soon learned that I channel Spirit through my chakras, and when it enters my crown, or head, chakra, I need to release it through my words. So when Spirit tried for all those years to deliver their messages, their energy would channel through my crown, but I&#x2019;d get scared and block it in my chest, causing my heart to race or my torso to feel heavy. I also learned that I am empathic, which means that the way I primarily communicate with Spirit is through sensing and feeling. So if, for instance, there was a soul that wanted to tell me they passed in a death connected to the throat or had trouble communicating toward the end of their life, I&#x2019;d feel my throat close, which triggered very real panic attacks. You can see why this was hard to understand and get under control without the right kind of help.<br> <br>Because I felt calmer after Pat&#x2019;s healing, I trusted her &#x201c;diagnosis&#x201d; and gradually learned how to control the energy around me. My anxieties became less dramatic, and I began to heal. After some hemming and hawing, I fully accepted my gift from God and devoted myself to helping others with my abilities. Soon I was channeling Spirit that included God, angels, guides, souls of faith like saints, and departed loved ones. I still sense and feel this Spirit today, but I&#x2019;ve also created a &#x201c;library&#x201d; of signs and symbols based on my own personal experiences; these images help relay messages in a way you can connect with and interpret.<br> <br>Pretty wild, right? Keep going. It gets better.<br> The Gist on Learning Lessons<p></p> <br>Now, I know you&#x2019;re an adult who can love, hate, forgive, blame, appreciate, trust, and reject any person or opportunity you wish. But I also want you to realize there&#x2019;s a more purposeful and fulfilling way to navigate life&#x2019;s ups and downs. Spirit tells me that you&#x2019;re meant to lead a meaningful existence, here in the physical world, that&#x2019;s joyful and satisfies your soul. And they&#x2019;ve guided me to the lessons that will show you how.<br> <br>If you read my book There&#x2019;s More to Life Than This, you&#x2019;ll remember that Spirit says your soul exists on the Other Side before you&#x2019;re born and after you die, and the reason you&#x2019;re here at all is to learn lessons that enrich your journey and help your soul mature in the afterlife. Well, as my abilities have grown, I&#x2019;ve noticed that many of the topics addressed during your readings can overlap, and Spirit has shown me that these are among the major lessons we&#x2019;re all meant to learn in this world. (When I channel your loved ones&#x2019; souls, they tell me about their lessons too.) The good news is, you don&#x2019;t need a PhD in theology to realize that these lessons reflect Spirit&#x2019;s, especially God&#x2019;s, priorities. They&#x2019;re easy to understand and offer simple, decisive, and direct guidance. Most truths do.<br> <br>Spirit&#x2019;s messages are life-changing, and their lessons are no exception. I think this is because both target the central issues that hold you back from healing and thriving at that moment. If you are new to a challenge, this immediately starts you on a journey to gaining perspective and feeling better; and if you can&#x2019;t get past hurdles or sticking points, Spirit tells you what to do to carry on. Bottom line, they know what works for you. They help you recognize what&#x2019;s in your heart and soul, and also what&#x2019;s missing, so you can embrace the life you desire. But since you can&#x2019;t always ask a medium for direction, Spirit wants you to be able to heed their advice on your own. You can do this by learning lessons that grow your soul and increase your awareness of what makes you feel whole.<br> <br>As you read, you&#x2019;ll begin to appreciate that you&#x2019;re in the physical world to be taught lessons in various ways. You&#x2019;ll see that your life has a purpose, that things happen for a reason, and why, why, why. You&#x2019;ll find the lessons in your own incredible and difficult situations. And the more you accept direction, the more intimately you&#x2019;ll understand your soul and trust your intuition and guidance to show you, and keep you on, the spiritual path you&#x2019;re meant to follow.<br> Spirit, the Ultimate Collaborator<p></p> <br>What&#x2019;s so astounding is that right after I decided to write a book about lessons, Spirit took its participation in this project to a whole other level. At my live shows, I noticed that similar struggles and experiences kept coming up in specific ways. So for example, in one night, I read three different people whose loved ones&#x2019; souls congratulated them on losing weight; on another, I channeled multiple children killed by guns; and within a ten-day span, Spirit was really into blurting out when women were secretly pregnant against all odds. It was ridiculous! There were also more spiritual &#x201c;themes,&#x201d; like angels, miracles, and inspiring dreams that made me stop and think. But what really blew my hair back&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s saying a lot&#x2014;was when people with related messages found each other after my shows to talk about their stories, exchange emails, laugh, hug, and just be there for one another. It&#x2019;s as if Spirit were organizing the book&#x2019;s material for me, while also creating a sense of community at my live events for the audience.<br> <br>Then I began the writing process, and things got even nuttier. While deciding which stories to use, I couldn&#x2019;t believe how many causes of death repeated themselves. A few of the stronger souls had the same names too, which I feel was synchronicity getting my attention and confirming that I was on the right spiritual track (synchronicity is like a coincidence, but it&#x2019;s when two or more events that seem unrelated come together in a meaningful way). And when my coauthor and I got in touch with subjects for interviews or to follow up on a reading, nine times out of ten we happened to do so on a significant day, like the anniversary or birthday of the loved one we were discussing!<br> <br>I never question Spirit, and my gut knew these unbelievable &#x201c;coincidences&#x201d; happened for a reason. Spirit always works in the most incredible and awe-inspiring ways. I believe Spirit made sure I realized that while we&#x2019;re all here to learn our own lessons, we share the challenges and triumphs that teach them to us. We learn from our lives and each other&#x2019;s, and this gives us hope that we can carry on in good and hard times. Our souls are connected in this world and the afterlife, so we&#x2019;re never really alone.<br> How to Use This Book<p></p> <br>Early on, Spirit insisted that the book&#x2019;s chapters appear in a progressive, intuitive order. They didn&#x2019;t suggest how to organize them exactly, so I trusted my instincts. I knew the first lesson had to be about faith, and the final lesson about healing, because those two subjects truly bookend every spiritual learning process. In between, the lessons I included build on and inform each other, but you won&#x2019;t get lost if you jump around based on how you&#x2019;re feeling that day. I&#x2019;ve also named each chapter according to a lesson that I feel Spirit wants you to know, but the main subjects of each (like patience, authenticity, love, gratitude, etc.) are what matter most. Finally, you&#x2019;ll notice that Spirit underscores the majority of their lessons with being the best person you can be, as you fulfill your journey, because your behavior has a sizable impact on others&#x2019; lessons too.<br> <br>Another thing that may stand out is that I talk a lot about God. As I&#x2019;ve emphasized many times, and will continue to say, I call the most brilliant source of energy and the creator of the universe God because I was raised Catholic and this supports my faith. But Spirit tells me there is only one God, so if you want to call him a Higher Power or a name that is more closely aligned with your beliefs, have at it. I just don&#x2019;t want you to dismiss Spirit&#x2019;s lessons if you can&#x2019;t relate to my use of the G-word. You have to understand, it&#x2019;s impossible to write a book about lessons without talking about Him, since they all originate with Him and His intentions for your life on earth. I also want to be clear that although Spirit has said these are influential lessons for soul growth, I am in no way saying that you need to master these to &#x201c;get into Heaven.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m shown that everyone crosses over and then, depending on how well you completed your lessons, according to the path your soul determined before you were born, you enter the Other Side on a level that reflects those standards.<br> <br>Last but not least, please don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m the final word on spiritual lessons. I can only tell you what I&#x2019;ve discovered that makes sense to me, and hope it resonates with you. More than anything, I think you&#x2019;ll find that this book is well worth the read for its amazing stories&#x2014;your amazing stories. You&#x2019;ll laugh, you&#x2019;ll cry, you&#x2019;ll learn, and I guarantee you&#x2019;ll squeeze your loved ones a little tighter the next time you see them.

Algorithms have made our lives more efficient, more entertaining, and, sometimes, better informed. At the same time, complex algorithms are increasingly violating the basic rights of individual citizens.

Meanwhile, users manipulate algorithms to "game" search engines, spam filters, online reviewing services, and navigation apps.<br><br>Understanding and improving the science behind the algorithms that run our lives is rapidly becoming one of the most pressing issues of this century.

We were attending a parade and block party to celebrate Boylestown&#x2019;s football team winning the state championship. Bess, her cousin George, and I all went to a rival school&#x2014;River Heights High&#x2014;so why were we celebrating with the competition? Well, George&#x2019;s cousin, Carrie Kim, had decided to run for Boylestown&#x2019;s town council, and she was making her first big speech at the block party. We all wanted to be there to show our support.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need another cotton candy,&#x201d; George, who was my other best friend, muttered with a frown. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll puke.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess turned back and shot George an annoyed glance. Bess is as blonde, curvy, and lively as George is dark, petite, and serious. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve become very good at refereeing their arguments.<br> <br>I held up a hand. &#x201c;Now ladies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to be such a grump.&#x201d; Bess frowned at George and looked down the street to where a parade would be starting any minute.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being a grump.&#x201d; George sighed, following Bess&#x2019;s gaze to where the Boylestown High School band was getting into formation. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s great that the Boylestown football team won the state championship. And I think it&#x2019;s great that the town is coming together to give them this parade.&#x201d;<br> <br>I cocked an eyebrow. I knew what was coming next. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>George looked flustered. &#x201c;But,&#x201d; she repeated, shrugging, &#x201c;I just wish towns like this would pay the same kind of attention to other accomplishments.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled sympathetically. I knew that George was speaking from her own experience as a nonathlete.<br> <br>&#x201c;Non-sports-related accomplishments,&#x201d; Bess filled in, and then shook her head. I could tell she&#x2019;d heard this argument before.<br> <br>One of the drummers in the marching band banged her drum, and we all looked over to see the band members begin marching in place. The parade was starting! The band began playing, and I could feel my heart beating in time with the thump-thump-thump of the drum. What is it about fight songs? They were playing Boylestown High&#x2019;s, and even though I never went to school there, it still made me want to jump up and down and cheer.<br> <br>As the band marched past us, I saw George straighten up and begin cheering. I knew my friend was really excited about the football team&#x2019;s win, deep down. I cheered too, clapping along to the beat of the song. The crowd suddenly erupted in hooting and applause, and I turned to see that the football players themselves were behind the band, each wearing his uniform and carrying his helmet in his hands. Bess stuck her fingers in her mouth and let out her famous Brain-Melting Whistle. George rolled her eyes and rubbed her temples, but notably didn&#x2019;t tell her cousin to stop.<br> <br>The Boylestown cheerleaders followed the players, but after them, the parade petered out. A few little kids marched by, waving pompoms or flags, but I had a feeling they were an unofficial addition to the parade. This hunch was proven when a few middle-aged parent-looking types scurried by just seconds after, trying to round up the kids.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; George asked. &#x201c;The band and the football team?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the cheerleaders,&#x201d; Bess corrected her, pulling some pink lip gloss out of her pocket and applying a perfectly shiny coat. I couldn&#x2019;t help being impressed&#x2014; how did she put it on so perfectly without a mirror? But I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised. Bess was an expert on all things clothing-, makeup-, or style-related. She would have been a total girly-girl, if she weren&#x2019;t also an amazing mechanic.<br> <br>George let out a puff of breath and ran a hand through her short, straight black hair. George&#x2019;s interest in makeup or style ran directly inverse to her cousin&#x2019;s; she couldn&#x2019;t care less. What she did care about was technology. It seemed to me that George could do anything with a computer: order up dinner, animate a short film, listen in on a conversation taking place across the world. She was also very concerned with justice and fairness. Which made her incredibly useful to me in following my own passion: catching crooks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, guys, let&#x2019;s get moving,&#x201d; Bess said, gesturing to the stream of people flowing into the street to follow the parade down to the school grounds, where a block party would soon take place. We moved into the crowd. All around us, I could hear snippets of conversation. I didn&#x2019;t mean to snoop, exactly&#x2014;it was just habit.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;such an amazing team&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;really incredible, it&#x2019;s been twelve years since BHS even made it to state!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;I know&#x2014;they&#x2019;re heroes!&#x201d;<br> <br>At those words, I heard George snort. She turned to face me, and I could tell from her expression that she&#x2019;d definitely heard the same snippets.<br> <br>&#x201c;Heroes?&#x201d; George asked the willowy redhead who&#x2019;d used the word. &#x201c;For getting a ball down a field?&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl turned to face George. She was a few inches taller, and peered with large green eyes down her narrow nose at this unexpected interrupter. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that easy,&#x201d; the girl retorted with a sniff. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see you try it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d like to see you write a 3-D animation program in C++!&#x201d; George cried.<br> <br>The girl frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what that even means,&#x201d; she muttered, before walking away and disappearing into the crowd.<br> <br>George kept staring at the place where the girl had stood. &#x201c;Exactly my point!&#x201d; She turned back to me and Bess and, seeing our faces, sighed. &#x201c;Look, guys, I don&#x2019;t want to ruin a fun day. It&#x2019;s just&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not everybody plays sports,&#x201d; Bess said in a slightly bored tone. Bess herself was quite the field hockey champ. It hadn&#x2019;t been long since she&#x2019;d brought home her own state championship trophy.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; said George, &#x201c;but almost everybody does something exciting that deserves attention. Did you know the Boylestown chess team is ranked among the top chess teams in the country?&#x201d;<br> <br>That surprised me. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that,&#x201d; I said, feeling a little bad that I hadn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s really cool.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is cool,&#x201d; George agreed. &#x201c;And it takes hard work. But nobody&#x2019;s giving those kids a parade.&#x201d;<br> <br>I bit my lip and glanced over at Bess. I could tell by her expression that she was thinking about what George had said. But before she could speak, her eyes widened and she stood taller and waved through the crowd. &#x201c;George&#x2014;it&#x2019;s Carrie! Hey, Carrie!&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked over where Bess was waving and saw George&#x2019;s rosy-cheeked, dark-haired cousin moving gracefully through the crowd. She wore a bright-blue suit with a red-striped blouse, and had a silver eagle pin on her lapel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; George said, grinning as her cousin approached. &#x201c;You really look the part!&#x201d;<br> <br>Carrie blushed and grinned back, gesturing to her suit. &#x201c;Do you like it? Julia, my campaign manager, thinks it&#x2019;s important that I look &#x2018;like someone who loves American democracy,&#x2019; &#x201d; she said, using finger quotes. A few weeks before, Carrie had told George that she was going to run for town council. George had thought it was a great idea&#x2014;Carrie was one of her favorite cousins, and she was qualified. She had spent the last three years working for a local congresswoman, and George knew she&#x2019;d be a great voice for the people of Boylestown.<br> <br>&#x201c;I always thought I loved American democracy,&#x201d; George said with a sly grin, gesturing down at her jeans and peasant blouse. &#x201c;But I guess, as usual, I&#x2019;m not dressing the right way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carrie reached out and playfully pushed her cousin. George smiled. &#x201c;Hey, so are you ready for your big speech?&#x201d;<br> <br>George had told us that Carrie&#x2014;herself a former tennis champion at BHS&#x2014;was set to introduce the players at the block party. First she would make a brief speech about her own experience as an athlete there, and her plans for the school, should she be elected.<br> <br>Carrie took a deep breath. &#x201c;I sure hope so. I have a major announcement to make today&#x2014;one that just might help me win this election!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess cocked her head with a smile. &#x201c;Do tell!&#x201d; Since Carrie was George&#x2019;s cousin on her mother&#x2019;s side of the family, Bess and Carrie weren&#x2019;t related. But I knew that she was just as impressed by Carrie&#x2019;s politics as George was. All of us knew Carrie pretty well, and growing up, we&#x2019;d all looked up to her.<br> <br>Carrie shook her head. &#x201c;No spoilers! You three will have to find out the big news with everyone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>George sighed. &#x201c;No fair! Just whisper it to me. Cousin&#x2019;s privilege.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carrie grinned. &#x201c;Learn some patience, little cousin.&#x201d; She reached out and ruffled George&#x2019;s hair before disappearing back into the crowd.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate it when she does that.&#x201d; George grimaced, trying to smooth her hair back into place.<br> <br>I patted her shoulder as we moved to get a good position several yards back from the stage. Already the band was filing into temporary bleachers, having moved on from the school fight song to &#x201c;America the Beautiful.&#x201d; I watched as Carrie moved through the crowd and stepped up onstage.<br> <br>The three of us waited patiently as the band played three more songs. Then the Boylestown principal got up and made a speech about how proud she was of the football team, and finally Carrie rose to speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here we go,&#x201d; George whispered. &#x201c;The reason we came!&#x201d;<br> <br>Carrie moved to the mic and introduced herself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Carrie Kim, I&#x2019;m running for town council, and I was also a state champion athlete at Boylestown High&#x2014;in tennis!&#x201d;<br> <br>The crowd went wild. &#x201c;Boylestown! Boylestown! Boylestown!&#x201d; a few boys to our right began chanting.<br> <br>Carrie raised her hand to silence them. &#x201c;Boylestown has a history of producing exceptional athletes, because the town values the ingredients that make a great athlete: strength, perseverance, and loyalty.&#x201d;<br> <br>She paused while the audience cheered.<br> <br>&#x201c;But in recent years,&#x201d; Carrie added, &#x201c;I believe that BHS, faced with some tough budgeting decisions, has let its facilities decline. As a town, we need to do more to support our high school athletes. The football field is in poor shape and on a rocky, uneven field. The bleachers are too small and in poor repair. Even the gymnasium at BHS is out of date. The football team has to work out at the Y, because they don&#x2019;t have adequate facilities at the school.&#x201d;<br> <br>The football players, who were lined up to go onstage, all nodded their heads in recognition. The crowd let out a few stray boos.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why,&#x201d; Carrie went on, &#x201c;if I&#x2019;m elected, the main goal of my first term will be to champion the building of an all-new football field and sports complex at BHS!&#x201d;<br> <br>If Carrie said anything after that, I couldn&#x2019;t hear it&#x2014;her voice was immediately eclipsed by screaming, clapping, and cheering from what seemed like the entire crowd. Bess was hooting as loudly as anyone else, and even I found myself pretty excited by it all. But then I noticed that George herself was only clapping halfheartedly, and her expression was troubled. I nudged her, and George shook her head. &#x201c;More money for sports,&#x201d; she whispered to me. &#x201c;Did you know BHS had to lay off three teachers last year? The town didn&#x2019;t budget enough to pay them.&#x201d;<br> <br>That dampened my enthusiasm a bit. Was George&#x2019;s cousin making a big mistake? But the crowd was still whooping and cheering. One of the football players ran up onstage and grabbed Carrie in a big bear hug. Carrie pulled away, laughing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll support my campaign for town council,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;Now, to the real reason we&#x2019;re here: to introduce the State Champion Boylestown Raiders!&#x201d;<br> <br>The crowd got loud again, and the awkward moment was forgotten in pure celebration. After about an hour, when the speeches and awards were over, the three of us moved off toward the BHS parking lot, where I&#x2019;d left my car. George spotted Carrie moving through the crowd too. She seemed to be headed for the parking lot but was making slow progress because people kept stopping her to shake her hand or give her a high five. &#x201c;Hey, cuz!&#x201d;<br> <br>Carrie spotted us and gestured for us to wait for her. A few minutes later&#x2014;after several handshakes, three high fives, and one kissed baby&#x2014;Carrie emerged, flushed and looking energized. &#x201c;Hey, guys! I think that went well, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Totally,&#x201d; George said.<br> <br>Carrie looked down at her hand, where she was clutching a folded piece of paper. &#x201c;Someone handed me this in the crowd,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not some guy&#x2019;s phone number!&#x201d; She opened up the note and looked down at it, and suddenly her face paled. &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Bess asked. When Carrie didn&#x2019;t respond and just kept staring down at the note, George reached over and took the paper from her cousin&#x2019;s hand. She tilted the note so all three of us could read it. I leaned in to get a better look, then gasped.<br> <br>NOT EVERYONE LOVES SPORTS. STOP YOUR CAMPAIGN &#x2014;OR YOU&#x2019;LL BE SORRY!</p><h2>A Bear Called Paddington</h2><p>&#34;A bear on Paddington Station?&#34; said Mrs Brown in amazement. &#34;Don&#39;t be silly -- there can&#39;t be.&#34; The Browns first met Paddington on a railway station -- Paddington station, in fact. He had travelled all the way from Darkest Peru with only a jar of marmalade, a suitcase and his hat. The Browns soon find that Paddington is a very unusual bear. Ordinary things -- like having a bath, travelling underground or going to the seaside become quite extraordinary, if a bear called Paddington is involved.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington--a most endearing bear from Darkest Peru--on a railway platform in London. A sign hanging around his neck said, "Please look after this bear. Thank you" So that is just what they did.<p></p><p>From the very first night when he attempted his first bath and ended up nearly flooding the house, Paddington was seldom far from imminent disaster. Jonathan and Judy were delighted with this havoc and even Mr. and Mrs. Brown had to admit that life seemed to be more filled with adventure when there was a bear in the house.</p>I wrote my first children's book in 1957 and it came about largely by accident. At that time I had been a part-time writer for about ten years, following a common progression in those days: short stories, newspaper and magazine articles, radio plays, plus a few short plays for television, I thought it was a good year if I sold one piece in ten. <p>Without giving the matter any great thought, I had always regarded writing for children as a lesser form of creativity-quite untrue, of course. As Gertrude Stein might have said-a book is a book is a book, and writing is perhaps even more of an agonizing process of distillation when it's for children. </p><p>There being nothing more soul-destroying than staring at a blank sheet of paper hoping something will happen (it won't unless you make it), I was sitting at the typewriter one morning when my gaze happened to alight on a toy bear I had bought my wife for Christmas. We called him Paddington, so I typed the words: "Mr and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington on a railway platform. In fact that was how he came to have such an unusual name for a bear, for Paddington was the name of the station." </p><p>Suddenly, I wanted to write more about this small character. Where had he come from? What was he doing in London? What were his reactions to life in England and the curious complications we humans make for ourselves? </p><p>Until that time I had always thought up stories and then tried to people them with characters. Suddenly, I learned a very simple fact of fictional life. If you create a believable character and you place it into a situation, events will develop naturally of their own accord. </p><p>Many of my radio and television plays had been light comedies which more often than not were returned with the comment "Sorry-no call for fantasy" written across the rejection slip. Nonsense, of course: All works of fiction are fantasy, and nothing could be more so than the concept of a bear with a penchant for marmalade sandwiches, who lives in Notting Hill Gate and speaks perfectly good English. But until then, I hadn't learned the trick of making it seem believable. That won't happen unless both you, the writer, and the characters in the story believe in it, too. </p><p>I wrote the first chapter very quickly, instinctively putting in all the things I felt I would have wanted as a child. More followed, and in ten days I had a finished book. </p><p>In retrospect, some thirty-five years and many books later, I think most fictional characters who enjoy longevity do so because someone, somewhere, at some time wrote about them for the very simple reason that they wanted to. </p><p>The first book of any series is the most fun to write; everything is fresh and exciting, and you can go anywhere your fancy takes you. Recapturing the original mood in subsequent books isn't always easy. Parameters have been set which dictate future stories; what the characters can and can't do. Paddington has the best of all worlds; he combines the naivet of a small child with the sophistication of an adult, plus ingredient "X"-his own peculiar brand of logic. Being a bear, he gets away with things without seeming precocious. The stories wouldn't work were he a small child. </p><p>Children hate being written down to or made to feel they are being patronized. They like their heroes to come out on top and the feeling of comfort that goes with a safe return to base or the comfort of a home. They also-quite rightly-dislike being sold short. </p><p>I hold the old-fashioned view that stories should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and the hardest part with Paddington is not getting him into trouble-he does this of his own accord-but getting him out of it in a way which is morally justifiable; someone must always benefit from his misdeeds however tenuously. </p><p>If fiction does nothing else, it provides a window on the world; perhaps showing things from a different viewpoint; even if-as in the case of another series I write about a guinea-pig called Olga da Polga-that window happens to be part of a hutch. </p><p>I once received a letter from a child who said she liked my books because they made pictures in her head. It was the nicest compliment I've ever had.</p></p><h2>Journey to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Force Collector</h2><p>Karr is a teenage boy like many others in the galaxy.

Then, as if overnight, one of the world&#x2019;s iconic cities emerged. At the heart of Los Angeles&#x2019; meteoric rise were three flawed visionaries: William Mulholland, an immigrant ditch-digger turned self-taught engineer, designed the massive aqueduct that would make urban life here possible. D.W. Griffith, who transformed the motion picture from a vaudeville-house novelty into a cornerstone of American culture, gave L.A. its signature industry. And Aimee Semple McPherson, a charismatic evangelist who founded a religion, cemented the city&#x2019;s identity as a center for spiritual exploration. <br><br>All were masters of their craft, but also illusionists, of a kind. The images they conjured up&#x2014;of a blossoming city in the desert, of a factory of celluloid dreamworks, of a community of seekers finding personal salvation under the California sun&#x2014;were like mirages liable to evaporate on closer inspection. All three would pay a steep price to realize these dreams, in a crescendo of hubris, scandal, and catastrophic failure of design that threatened to topple each of their personal empires.

Another sound followed a moment later. It was less violent but more ominous: the low, rolling, slowly deepening roar of rushing water.</p><p>Someone had bombed the Los Angeles Aqueduct. A case of stolen dynamite, fitted out with a blasting cap and a makeshift fuse, had exploded under the Alabama Gatehouse, located about 210 miles north of the city, near the remote town of Lone Pine in the Owens Valley. One of the building&#x2019;s five spillgates&#x2014;thick metal doors designed to release excess water from the aqueduct after heavy storms&#x2014;had been ripped apart, allowing two hundred cubic feet of water per second to pour uselessly down a spillway and out across the parched valley floor. By the time the aqueduct&#x2019;s flow could be shut off at another gate some twenty miles north of the breach, over one hundred million gallons would be wasted&#x2014;in one of the driest corners of the country, in the middle of one of the worst droughts in years.</p><p>By the time Detective Jim Bilyeu of the Inyo County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department arrived on the scene, a small crowd of Lone Pine residents had gathered near the still-smoking gatehouse. Some were actually applauding the destruction, pounding each other on the back in celebration. Hostility toward the aqueduct&#x2014;and toward the distant, insatiably thirsty city that had built it&#x2014;was widespread across the sparsely populated Owens Valley in 1976, and many locals felt that the L.A. Department of Water and Power (LADWP) had been dealt a well-deserved blow. &#x201c;If I ever find out who bombed the gates,&#x201d; one man allegedly re- marked, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy him a steak dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>This resentment was not new. Ever since the city built the aqueduct in the early 1900s, tensions between Los Angeles and the Owens Val- ley had been high. Many in the valley felt that the city had stolen their water, acquiring property and water use rights under false pretenses and then greedily drawing off the flow of the Owens River, allowing L.A. to flourish while the local economy languished. This valley&#x2014;despite being a &#x201c;Land of Little Rain,&#x201d; as one local writer had famously called it&#x2014; was at one time an aspiring agricultural region. In the decades around the turn of the century, plentiful water from the Owens River, which gathered the runoff of forty mountain streams in the nearby high Sierra Nevada and channeled it through the otherwise arid region, had sustained livestock and irrigated fields all up and down the hundred-mile- long valley. At its southern end, the river had even broadened out into a large, shallow lake, where local residents could go boating and migrating waterfowl could cavort among the swaying reeds.</p><p>Then in 1913, the aqueduct had come, and most of that water had been taken&nbsp;away&nbsp;to&nbsp;nurture&nbsp;the&nbsp;growth&nbsp;of far-off Los Angeles. The people of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Owens&nbsp;Valley had&nbsp;rebelled.&nbsp;Several&nbsp;times during&nbsp;the drought-stricken 1920s, they&nbsp;had&nbsp;responded&nbsp;with dynamite,&nbsp;bombing the aqueduct at various points along its 233-mile path. Relations between city and valley remained poisonous for years. Eventually, though, the parties came to a compromise, declaring an uneasy truce, and the bombings stopped.</p><p>Now, decades later, the LADWP was trying to wring yet more water from the valley. To meet the city&#x2019;s needs during this latest drought, they had begun intensive pumping of the valley&#x2019;s groundwater basin, threatening to destroy what was left of the region&#x2019;s vegetation and turning the lower Owens River into nothing more than a dry ditch, winding down the valley to a barren alkaline plain that had once been a lake. No won- der, then, that those people standing around the ruined gatehouse were applauding the bombers. As one valley resident later admitted, &#x201c;We&#x2019;d all thought about doing something like that&#x2014;but they actually hauled off and did it. So we . . . clinked beer bottles in their honor.&#x201d;</p><p>Not that this latter-day echo of the 1920s bombing campaign caused Los Angeles much harm. A series of reservoirs much closer to the city held enough water in reserve to ensure that Angelenos suffered no short- ages or interruptions in their service. Within a few days of the sabotage, the shattered spillgate was already repaired and the aqueduct was flowing again. County and federal authorities lost no time in ferreting out the perpetrators: two young locals who, after a few beers, had decided that they were fed up with the city&#x2019;s water-grabbing and decided to do something about it. For the bombing of the Alabama Gatehouse, they were eventually indicted, tried, and sentenced to minor jail terms. After doing their time, they were allowed to fade into obscurity.</p><p>It was a pattern that had developed over many years: Los Angeles siphoning off resources, industry, and population from elsewhere to satisfy its insatiable desire for growth. The city&#x2019;s leaders had turned this process into something of an art form, getting what was needed to prosper by whatever means necessary. Water was only one of the city&#x2019;s requirements, and the stagnation of the Owens Valley only one of the consequences of this voracity.</p><p>The Owens Valley, meanwhile, just grew drier, and&#x2014;as it had for decades&#x2014;the great megalopolis to the south just grew bigger and thirstier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Implausible City</b></p><p>It struck me as an odd thing that here, alone of all the cities in America, there was no plausible answer to the question, &#x201c;Why did a town spring up here and why has it grown so big?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;Morris Markey, journalist and California historian</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA</p><p>1900 &#x2013; 1930</p><p>It&nbsp;was&nbsp;no&nbsp;sensible&nbsp;place to build a&nbsp;great&nbsp;city.&nbsp;This corner&nbsp;of southern California&#x2014;often bone dry, lacking a natural harbor, and isolated from the rest of the country by expansive deserts and rugged mountain ranges&#x2014;offered few of the inducements to settlement and growth found near major cities in other places. The Spaniards, who first explored the region in 1542, declined to put down roots here for over two centuries; even then, in the 1700s, they sent mainly soldiers and Franciscan friars to establish missions and convert the local Indians to Christianity. When the Mexicans took over in 1821, they settled the area a little more heavily but still regarded it as a province, a hinterland, a backwater without the water.</p><p>Only after the Mexican War of 1846&#x2013;48, when southern California became American, did anyone really start to postulate a grand metropolis in this desert, centered on a narrow, unreliable waterway known optimistically as the Los Angeles River. Only Americans, it seems, could dream of something so unlikely, so contrary to simple common sense. Of necessity, the place would have to be forced, like an amaryllis out of season. A certain amount of contrivance, or even trickery, would be required to bring resources, population, and industry to a place that lacked them all. But eventually the implausible became actual. By the end of the 1920s, the world city of Los Angeles, California, was a reality&#x2014;an urban giant grown up in a place where no city should rightly be.</p><p>This book is the story of this extraordinary transformation. It begins in 1900, when Los Angeles was still a largely agricultural town of some 100,000 residents (and one that the National Irrigation Congress regarded as having &#x201c;no future&#x201d; as anything larger). The explosive growth that followed over the next three decades had nothing natural or inevitable about it. Each step in the city&#x2019;s evolution had to be conceived, engineered, and then sold to an often-skeptical public. And as with any evolutionary process, not all visions of the city&#x2019;s future survived this test. Some would die quickly and fruitlessly; others would prove unsustain- able over the long term, pushed aside by the interests of richer and more powerful elements in the population. But a few would leave an outsize mark on the city, taking root and giving rise to a metropolis unlike any other in the world. The pivotal period from 1900 to 1930 would witness, most notably, the realization of one of the largest and most controversial public works projects in history, second in magnitude only to the Panama Canal at the time; the invention of an entirely new form of entertainment&#x2014;and of a new kind of industry to produce and sell it; and the flowering of a seductive urban ethos&#x2014;arguably the birth of the whole idea of a &#x201c;lifestyle&#x201d;&#x2014;based on utopian notions of leisure, physical wellness, and spiritual fulfillment. This combination of urban growth factors was unique, and it proved to be uniquely effective. By 1930, for better or worse, Los Angeles emerged as a major city of over 1.2 million people, and one with a distinctive identity: as an obscenely wasteful but alluring garden in the desert, as the focus of the entire world&#x2019;s movie dreams (and often its moral censure), and as the heliocentric mecca of spiritual seekers across the country. Every city can be regarded as an artificial construct, an audacious projection of human will, imagination, and vanity onto the natural landscape; but none was more artificial&#x2014;or more audacious&#x2014;than this one.</p><p>Single individuals do not build cities, but three L.A. icons&#x2014;an engineer, an artist, and an evangelist&#x2014;both embodied and, to a unique extent, drove the three major engines of the city&#x2019;s rise from provincial player to world-class star. William Mulholland (the engineer) was L.A.&#x2019;s fabled water czar, whose wildly ambitious vision of a 233-mile aqueduct brought water to the desert and allowed the city to grow far beyond its natural capacity to support urban life. David Wark Griffith (the artist) was the&nbsp;seminal film&nbsp;director&nbsp;of&nbsp;the silent era,&nbsp;the man who&nbsp;almost&nbsp;single-handedly&nbsp;transformed&nbsp;the&nbsp;motion picture&nbsp;from&nbsp;a vaudeville-house novelty into a major creative (and fabulously lucrative) industry, important enough to help build a city. And Aimee Semple McPherson (the evangelist) was the charismatic faith healer and pioneering radio preacher who, courting both scandal and fanatical devotion, founded her own religion and cemented southern California&#x2019;s reputation as a national hub for seekers of unorthodox spirituality and self- realization.</p><p>In this marginal and unfinished corner of the country, each of these three innovators discovered a kind of tabula rasa, an environment offering enough physical and mental space to permit their ideas to develop and ultimately flourish. Far from the entrenched attitudes and rigid power hierarchies of the hidebound East, each was free to create a distinctive vision of the city&#x2019;s future and do the hard creative work to give it concrete form.</p><p>The images they conjured up&#x2014;of a blossoming city in the desert, of a thriving factory of celluloid dreamworks, of a community of seekers finding personal salvation under God&#x2019;s good sunshine&#x2014;all had elements of the swindle about them, like mirages whose heady promises could evaporate on closer inspection. Each was tested by strong counter- currents of opposition, as scandals and accusations of corruption and malfeasance erupted continually to threaten their chances of realization. But the images proved resilient. More important, they succeeded in bringing the Los Angeles we know into being: people were enticed by the images; they came to live and work here; the city grew.</p><p>In the end, Mulholland, Griffith, and McPherson all paid a price for their ambitions. Each self-destructed in the late 1920s in spectacular fashion, finally succumbing to shifting tides of popular morality and technological change. All three found themselves humiliated and reviled as a fickle public turned against them. But while these individuals fell, the city they had worked to build barely registered their loss, entering the 1930s as the largest and fastest-growing U.S. city west of the Mississippi.</p><p>Few people could have imagined it all back at the turn of the century, when the dusty town of Los Angeles seemed destined to remain the thirty-sixth largest in the nation, behind places like Indianapolis, Toledo, and even Fall River, Massachusetts. What made the difference for L.A. was a combination of many different acts of imagination and engineering, supported by a great deal of sometimes deceptive advertising. But these efforts, large and small, gave the city what it needed to thrive: a source of water to sustain it, an industry to support its growth, and an ethos to bring it fame and notoriety. And in the process, this improbable place&#x2014;the grand metropolis that never should have been&#x2014; moved inexorably from the margins to the center of American life and consciousness.</p></p><h2>Albrecht D�rer</h2><p>Now available in a new edition, this lavishly illustrated volume draws on the latest research to present an exciting new interpretation of Albrecht Du&#x308;rer, both as a man and as an artist. Albrecht Du&#x308;rer&#x2019;s prints and drawings have inspired hundreds of artists, both during his life and after his death. Yet his talent as a painter and colorist, and his enthusiasm for the scientific world have not been widely appreciated. Du&#x308;rer&#x2019;s influence was both international and intergenerational&#x2015;indeed Picasso claimed to have been inspired by the 16th-century artist. Reproduced in stunning detail and including illustrations of Du&#x308;rer&#x2019;s most famous prints and drawings, a catalog raisonne&#x301; of his paintings, and biographical research, this book presents a Du&#x308;rer for the 21st century. Producing more self-portraits than any other artist of his day; mass marketing his best-selling prints; even inventing his own monogram logo; Albrecht Du&#x308;rer was commercially astute long before today&#x2019;s generation of self-promoting and financially-savvy artists. There are 55 extant Du&#x308;rer paintings, of which 17 are in dispute. Using scientific research, this book puts all arguments to bed resulting in the definitive catalog raisonne&#x301; of the paintings. Drawing on in-depth research, this book reveals the truth behind Du&#x308;rer and his art.</p><p>Norbert Wolf is an art historian, whose numerous books include <i>Art Deco, Impressionism: Reimagining Art, Art Nouveau,</i> and <i>The Art of the Salon: The Triumph of Nineteenth-Century Painting</i> (all by Prestel)."The catalogue is full of beautiful reproductions and numerous close-ups, and the enlarged reproductions of engravings invite contemplation of the artist&#x2019;s mastery of line." -<i>The Art Newspaper</i></p><h2>The Curry Guy: Recreate Over 100 of the Best Indian Restaurant Recipes at Home</h2><p>Dan Toombs (aka The Curry Guy) has perfected the art of replicating Indian Restaurant cooking after traveling around the UK, sampling dishes, learning the curry house kitchen secrets, and refining those recipes at home.

I had practiced self-defense. I had studied how to remain calm under pressure. I had read everything I could find on mortal combat. And so I had hoped that when the time came and I found myself in the thick of battle, I would be able to handle myself with cool, spy-like aplomb.<br> <br>Instead, I was screaming.<br> <br>Thankfully, it wasn&#x2019;t a girly shriek. It was more of a sustained &#x201c;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&#x201d; Which could be roughly translated as: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in serious trouble. Someone please help me.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s one thing to study action sequences. It&#x2019;s a whole other thing to find yourself in the middle of one.<br> <br>I dodged through piles of dirt and debris, aware the agents were gaining on me. They were all screaming too, although this was more of a war cry. Translation: &#x201c;Once we catch you, you&#x2019;re dead meat.&#x201d; I was dressed for combat, clad from head to toe in camouflage gear, but it obviously wasn&#x2019;t working, because the enemy could see me perfectly well. Sniper fire whistled past me. Something screeched through the air high above and exploded in the distance.<br> <br>Not far ahead, a foxhole came into view. To most people, it would have looked like just a big, grubby hole in the dirt, but to me, it was beautiful.<br> <br>I shouted into my radio headset, &#x201c;Erica! I&#x2019;m coming in hot!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Erica replied calmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t sound like she was in the heat of battle at all. Instead, she sounded bizarrely relaxed, as though she were lounging in a hammock at a beach resort.<br> <br>I leapt into the foxhole. It was four feet deep. Erica Hale sat inside, leaning against the dirt wall, casually leafing through a Guns &amp; Ammo magazine despite all the chaos around her. Like me, she was wearing camouflage gear, but somehow she looked stylish in hers. Then again, Erica would have looked stylish in a potato sack. She was the most beautiful girl I&#x2019;d ever met, as well as the smartest, the most athletic, and the deadliest.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a horde of enemy agents right behind me,&#x201d; I panted. &#x201c;Heavily armed. They ambushed me as I was nearing the objective . . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ben, take it easy.&#x201d; Erica calmly tucked the magazine into her knapsack. &#x201c;What are you so worked up about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to be here any second!&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;And they&#x2019;re ruthless!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re twelve years old,&#x201d; Erica said flatly.<br> <br>She had a good point. They were only twelve. And the war around us was merely a combat simulation. We were in the midst of our traditional Survival and Combat Skills Assessment exam at the CIA&#x2019;s Academy of Espionage. Our weapons were only paintball guns, and the battlefield was a mock-up on the academy firing range. But it felt real enough.<br> <br>&#x201c;Some of them are pretty big twelve-year-olds,&#x201d; I said defensively.<br> <br>Their war cry was growing louder. They were almost upon us.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many of them are there?&#x201d; Erica asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven.&#x201d;<br> <br>In one fluid movement, Erica sprang to her feet and fired her paintball gun over the lip of the foxhole. Five shots, each punctuated by the yelp of someone being hit squarely by a paint-filled projectile.<br> <br>Erica took cover again, grinning. &#x201c;Now there&#x2019;s only two,&#x201d; she informed me.<br> <br>If there was anyone you wanted in your foxhole, it was Erica Hale. Although she was only fifteen, she was easily the most talented spy-in-training at school. She&#x2019;d practically been preparing for it since birth: Spying was her family business. Most of her ancestors had been spies, going all the way back to Nathan Hale in the Revolutionary War. Her grandfather Cyrus Hale was one of the best there&#x2019;d ever been, and he&#x2019;d taught Erica almost everything he knew.<br> <br>On the other hand, I came from a long line of grocers. I was only thirteen, and until seven months earlier, my entire espionage experience had consisted of watching James Bond movies. Since then, however, I&#x2019;d twice been involved in thwarting the plots of SPYDER, a secretive subversive organization dedicated to causing chaos and mayhem. Thus, I&#x2019;d seen far more action than most of my fellow students. But that didn&#x2019;t mean I was comfortable in the heat of battle, be it real or pretend.<br> <br>Today was a good example. It was our first day back at school for the fall semester, time for the annual Survival and Combat Skills Assessment. When I was inducted, it was the middle of the school year, so my SACSA had been a solo exam. But now the school administration had to assess the entire first-year class&#x2014;and reassess all the returning students&#x2014;at the same time. There were six grades (seventh through twelfth) with fifty kids in each. Three hundred people. Thus, the full-scale fake battle. The school had been divided into two teams: red (them) and blue (us). Each was assigned to steal a heavily guarded objective from the other side while protecting their own. It was basically an enormous, potentially painful version of capture the flag. Since it was only a game&#x2014;and the kids who&#x2019;d been chasing me were all newbies&#x2014;I probably should have been as calm as Erica, but I wasn&#x2019;t. I was still on edge, terrified of screwing up in front of the professors, who were watching closely from the sidelines and grading our performance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you only have five paintballs in your ammo clip?&#x201d; I asked Erica.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I have plenty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why didn&#x2019;t you take out all seven enemy agents?&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica shrugged. &#x201c;What fun would that be?&#x201d;<br> <br>With a primal scream, the two remaining newbies leapt into our foxhole, guns primed, ready to paint us cherry red. One of them was staggeringly large for a boy his age. He was built like a sequoia tree. The other was a surprisingly small girl. She looked like a heavily armed elf.<br> <br>Thankfully, Erica took the guy. Before he could get a shot off, she&#x2019;d launched herself into action, sweeping his legs out from under him and wrenching his gun away. Then she dispatched him with a shot to the chest, coating his torso in blue paint.<br> <br>I attacked the girl. It felt a bit mean to attack an elf, but this one was aiming a gun at me. I wasn&#x2019;t as adept as Erica, but my fighting skills had improved at school. Before I&#x2019;d arrived, I wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to beat a small girl in a fight. Now I could. It wasn&#x2019;t very chivalrous, but my grade was on the line. I shoved the elf&#x2019;s gun aside as she fired. The paintball whizzed past me, leaving a red splotch on the side of the foxhole. Then I barreled into her, knocking her flat as I snapped the gun from her grasp. I swung it around, preparing to blast her.<br> <br>Only, the elf started crying. &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; she wailed. &#x201c;I quit!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You quit?&#x201d; I asked, thrown. &#x201c;Er . . . I don&#x2019;t think you can do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I could hack it here, but I was wrong,&#x201d; the elf sobbed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too hard! I want to go home! I want my mommy!&#x201d;<br> <br>I lowered the gun, feeling bad for how hard I&#x2019;d knocked her down. &#x201c;Sorry. Spy school&#x2019;s not for everyone . . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like you?&#x201d; The elf&#x2019;s crying suddenly stopped. The whole &#x201c;I want my mommy&#x201d; thing had been an act. I tried to shoot her, but she lashed out a leg, catching me behind the knee. I crashed to the ground, the gun tumbling from my grasp. The elf pounced on it and swung the barrel toward me . . . .<br> <br>Erica blew her away. She fired six times, coating the elf in blue, then pointed to the sidelines. &#x201c;Nice try, newbie. But you&#x2019;re out.&#x201d;<br> <br>The elf now looked like a Smurf. A really angry one. &#x201c;You got lucky this time,&#x201d; she sneered at me. &#x201c;Next time, your girlfriend might not be around to save you.&#x201d; Then she stormed off toward the &#x201c;morgue&#x201d; on the sidelines, where her fellow paint-splattered corpses watched the battle play out.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not his girlfriend!&#x201d; Erica yelled after her.<br> <br>I staggered back to my feet, brushing myself off. &#x201c;Man, that girl was devious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She was,&#x201d; Erica agreed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll do well here.&#x201d;<br> <br>I watched the elf trudge past the reviewing stands. Professor Kuklinski, who taught advanced biochemical weaponry, appeared disappointed in her performance, while Professor Greenwald-Smith, who taught counterespionage, seemed to be giving her some words of encouragement. Next to them, Professor Crandall, who taught self-preservation, had dozed off in his chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; I said to Erica, &#x201c;when normal kids go back to school, their first day is all about getting oriented and meeting their teachers. There&#x2019;s no paint guns or fighting or pretending to kill one another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Erica asked. &#x201c;It must suck to be normal.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pried a clod of dirt from my ear, then scoped out the battlefield around us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d probably better get back in the game before I get dinged for slacking off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; Erica said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you end up with all those newbies after you in the first place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Chip and Jawa set up an ambush for me. I thought I had a chance at the objective, but it was a trap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure it was their doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Definitely. I saw them sic the newbies on me.&#x201d; Although they were on the opposing team, Chip Schacter and Jawaharlal O&#x2019;Shea were two of my closest friends at spy school. Jawa was extremely smart. Chip was extremely sneaky and underhanded. Together, they made a formidable combination.<br> <br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t come after you themselves?&#x201d; Erica asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They probably knew you and I would be working together,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;So let&#x2019;s work together to take them out.&#x201d; Erica started sketching a plan in the dirt with the barrel of her paintball gun.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d drawn only two lines when an emergency call came over my headset: &#x201c;Smokescreen, you out there? We need your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Zoe Zibbell, another of my close friends, only she was on our team today. Zoe had christened me &#x201c;Smokescreen&#x201d; shortly after my recruitment because she had mistakenly believed that my initial incompetence was an act designed to catch my enemies off guard. (&#x201c;No one could be that inept,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d once explained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen turtles that could fight better.&#x201d;) Since then, I had gained a considerable amount of skill and savvy, but the nickname had stuck.<br> <br>I radioed back. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the situation?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Chameleon doesn&#x2019;t know how to work the mortar,&#x201d; Zoe reported.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I do!&#x201d; shouted Warren Reeves&#x2014;aka Chameleon&#x2014;in the background. Warren was gifted at camouflage but mediocre at just about everything else.<br> <br>The mortar was a new addition to the SACSA exams. The administration at spy school had decided it was time for us to learn how to use heavy artillery.<br> <br>I chanced a look out of the foxhole toward our mortar base, a makeshift bunker atop a slope at one end of the firing range. From what I knew, the mortar was an actual working cannon; only the ammunition had been altered. Instead of shells, it fired paint bombs big enough to take out a dozen people at once.<br> <br>There were several red enemy agents between us and the base.<br> <br>Erica got on the radio with us. &#x201c;No dice. Smokescreen is assigned to target acquisition, not heavy artillery. You&#x2019;ll have to work this out yourselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No can do, Ice Queen,&#x201d; Zoe replied. &#x201c;The situation is dire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How dire?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; Zoe said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re about to see.&#x201d;<br> <br>A second later, I heard Warren yell, &#x201c;Fire in the hole!&#x201d; followed by a loud explosion. A paint bomb blasted out of the bunker. Only, I could immediately tell something was wrong. Instead of arcing toward the enemy base at the opposite end of the battlefield, the bomb soared almost straight up, then began screaming downward&#x2014;right toward us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take cover!&#x201d; Erica yelled.<br> <br>For once, I was already ahead of her. We threw ourselves into the protected side of the foxhole just as the bomb detonated on the ground above us. A wave of blue paint sailed over our heads and splattered the rest of the hole.<br> <br>I peered back out of the foxhole. The ground for thirty feet in every direction was a ring of blue. A third-year red team member on her way to the morgue had caught the worst of it. She was now coated with paint.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not cool!&#x201d; she howled. &#x201c;I was already dead!&#x201d;<br> <br>Several of our own team members had been hit as well. Most had been caught only in the arm or the leg, but that was enough to remove them from the game. They were all shouting things at our mortar base that would have gotten them detention at a normal school.<br> <br>I got back on the radio. &#x201c;You guys nearly killed us just now!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Warren said. &#x201c;My bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica took in the carnage and sighed. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she radioed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bringing Smokescreen in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even though it&#x2019;s not our assignment?&#x201d; I asked. Erica usually wasn&#x2019;t one to defy orders. Not when her perfect grade point average was on the line.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a calculated risk. If we leave those two cheeseheads in charge of the mortar, we may not have a team much longer. Stay close to me.&#x201d; With that, Erica grabbed her knapsack, sprang out of the foxhole, and raced toward base.<br> <br>I did exactly as she&#x2019;d ordered. En route to the base, several opposing team members made the mistake of attacking us. Erica thwarted them so easily, she almost looked bored. I actually caught her yawning while she knocked one enemy agent unconscious.<br> <br>A few opponents who were older students&#x2014;and thus familiar with Erica&#x2019;s reputation&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t even bother to attack. Instead, they simply dropped their weapons and surrendered. This wasn&#x2019;t going to earn them a lot of points on their exam, but it was far less painful than having Erica take them out.<br> <br>Even though I should have been covering our backs, I couldn&#x2019;t help but watch Erica. In the first place, she could probably cover our backs better than I could, even while being attacked from the front. And second, Erica in action was a thing of beauty. It was like watching a prima ballerina perform Swan Lake, only with a lot more screaming. I already had a tremendous crush on Erica, and somehow, watching her wipe out a field full of enemies made her even more alluring.<br> <br>I was sure Erica knew about my crush. After all, she was our finest spy-in-training; keeping a secret from her was like trying to hide meat from a dog. Erica had never let on the slightest bit, but then, human interaction wasn&#x2019;t her strong suit. She barely deigned to speak to anyone else at school&#x2014;including our professors&#x2014;so I knew not to expect too much. Frankly, I was thrilled that she had been willing to team up with me.<br> <br>Erica calmly took out the last two opponents as we arrived at our mortar base, leaving them whimpering in pain. We clambered over the bunker wall only to have Zoe nearly blast us away.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s us, you nitwit!&#x201d; Erica yelled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry!&#x201d; Zoe apologized, holstering her gun.<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t take long to scope out the bunker, as it was only a few feet across. The mortar sat in the center next to a pile of artillery. It was smaller than I&#x2019;d expected, like a sawed-off cannon. Warren stood beside it, frantically flipping through the instruction manual.<br> <br>Zoe hugged me with relief. &#x201c;Thank goodness you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Warren glowered jealously, as he always did whenever Zoe showed me any affection.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying to take out the enemy mortar base, but we can&#x2019;t get the targeting right,&#x201d; Zoe reported.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll handle it,&#x201d; Erica said, then pointed to Zoe and ordered, &#x201c;Stay on guard.&#x201d; Then she pointed to me and ordered, &#x201c;Work out the trajectory.&#x201d; Then she pointed to Warren and ordered, &#x201c;Move.

At the time, I was more concerned about my career. Settling down was the last thing on my mind because I was having too much fun. But meeting Jay and a few years of growing up changed everything.<br><br>So, at just 24 years old, I became pregnant with my first. It was interesting timing considering Jay and I had only recently gotten back together after breaking off our engagement. But after 3 months of working on the relationship and being back together, we completely committed to our future together. Conceiving Camden was an in-the-moment decision that we both felt strongly about; it would end up being the best thing we ever did.<br><br>PREGNANCY<br>In November 2011, I had just finished taping the season finale of Dancing with the Stars and Jay was smack in the middle of the football season and had just broken his thumb. When I joined him in Vail where he was to get surgery on his hand, we took a pregnancy test, even though I thought it was a long shot since we hadn't been together much the previous month. Sure enough, the test showed up negative. Both of us felt surprisingly let down. But we carried on, spending Thanksgiving with my dad in Laguna Beach the following day. A couple of days later, we decided I should take another test because I was still unusually late. This time the results were positive. We were both a little stunned, having convinced ourselves there wouldn't be a baby when the first pregnancy test had been negative. We kissed and hugged immediately and set off on this incredible journey together. It was an amazing time for us both. Being pregnant was the first time in my life where I felt like everything was on the right track and I was doing exactly what I was meant to be doing.<br><br>FOOD<br>My eating was the number one thing that changed when I became pregnant--and that effect still resonates today. Becoming pregnant made me get serious about my health. Before pregnancy, I thought zero-calorie food was good for you and every calorie was equal. Deep down, I knew that my eating habits weren't truly healthful, but I put a lot of pressure on myself to be thin. I was my own worst critic: I hated the way I looked in certain pictures. Everyone around me was tiny, and I felt like I had to be too. I thought counting calories gave me control over my body.<br><br>If it was good-quality, real food, I would give in to cravings and enjoy every second.<br><br>But when I became pregnant, I knew that everything I did, and especially what I ate, had a direct effect on my baby. I was solely responsible for the well-being of this little life and wanted only the best for him. That drastically changed my attitude toward food, which previously had been based only on eating a certain number of calories. For the first time in my life, I didn't care if I gained a lot of weight. It was a time to eat well and eat smart, and even to indulge in food that was forever off-limits in my prepregnancy life, including "fattening" things like cheese and pasta. I decided not to look at calories but instead to read ingredient labels and to reevaluate my ideas about avoiding so-called fattening foods. No matter what, I would eat only real food, no processed, chemical-laden junk. If it was good-quality, real food, I would give in to cravings and enjoy every second.<br><br>Pregnancy Snacks<br>I was constantly eating during pregnancy. I found it hard to eat big meals and loved grazing throughout the day. Eating smaller meals and snacking often cut down on my heartburn and kept my energy up. Some of my favorite snacks were:<br><br>� Hummus with carrot and celery sticks<br>�&nbsp;Guacamole with broccoli and cauliflower florets<br>�&nbsp;Homemade trail mix (nuts of choice, chocolate-covered goji berries, and dried cherries)<br>�&nbsp;Cheese slices with either an apple or flaxseed crackers<br>�&nbsp;A hard-cooked egg<br>�&nbsp;Smoothies (see the recipes on pages 20 and 21)<br><br><b>MINTY GREEN SMOOTHIE</b><br><br>I have a smoothie almost every morning, and this one is so good you will forget it's actually healthful. The peppermint in this smoothie saved me during the first trimester of my third pregnancy. I was incredibly nauseous, and this smoothie (which tastes like an ice-cream shake) calmed my stomach.<br><br>MAKES 1 SMOOTHIE<br><br>1 1/4 cups almond milk<br>1 avocado, peeled and pitted<br>1 handful spinach, stems removed<br>1 frozen banana<br>1 heaping tablespoon honey<br>1/4 teaspoon spirulina powder<br>1/4-1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract (not oil)<br><br>In a blender, combine the almond milk, avocado, spinach, banana, honey, spirulina, and peppermint extract to taste until smooth and creamy.

Pour into a glass and enjoy.<br><br>EXERCISING WITH THE BUMP<br><br>One of the most important things I did to take care of my body during pregnancy was work out. I didn't take it too hard and instead gave myself permission to slow down and go easy: I just wanted to move and get the blood flowing a few times a week. One of the main reasons I love working out is to keep myself sane. If I go longer than 5 days without doing something, I stress out easily and become irritable. Not good, especially with the added hormones and exhaustion of being pregnant. Exercise was important for my mental health as much as for the physical benefits.<br><br>Working out during my second pregnancy wasn't as easy, since my firstborn, Camden, was now on the scene. So the only thing I did was exercise at home (often while he napped) to DVD routines that mainly focused on my legs and butt. Sometimes Cam would hang with me while I followed the DVDs. To this day, he likes to "work out with Mommy" and kicks his legs and puts bands around his ankles like it shows on the DVDs. It's pretty darn cute.<br><br>WORKING OUT WHILE PREGNANT<br><br>Low-impact workouts a few times a week really helped my mind and my body while pregnant. Here are some of the exercises I loved.<br><br>Walking uphill on the treadmill.<br><br>Using a stairclimber--it's great cardio that isn't too hard on the body with the extra weight of a bump!<br><br>Lifting light weights.<br><br>Stretching with prenatal yoga--I loved this! It helped with the aches and pains in my lower back.<br><br>Following DVDs of floor exercises--I did one called the Brazil Butt Lift, which obviously focused on my legs and butt.<br><br>TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF<br><br>I found all of my pregnancies to be relatively easy. I owe a huge part of this to diet but also to how I took care of myself physically. I learned how to listen to my body and to go easy when need be. If that meant I was in bed every night at 8:00 p.m., so be it! I also made an effort to be kind to myself in simple, everyday ways. Pampering myself at home on a Saturday required next to nothing and made me feel like a million bucks (see "Mini- Spa Day at Home" on page 25). And instead of meeting up with friends or leaving the house most nights, I simply savored coconut milk or cashew "ice cream" (see pages 227 and 228 for recipes) in bed and caught up on all my favorite shows (well, during the first pregnancy anyway!). It was heaven.<br><br>There is no better time to get in tune with your body than during pregnancy. It's an amazing thing to recognize exactly when you need to slow down. Truly knowing what you need and putting yourself first are often the best preventive medicine. I figured out how to read the signs pretty quickly and tried not to feel guilty or like I was missing out when I opted to stay home in pajamas instead of going to dinner with friends.<br><br>For example, I learned that attending a horse race in the summer is not the best activity for a pregnant woman. Who would have thought? But I hadn't had the foresight to realize that this sort of thing--which I'd always considered fun--was not going to work for me at 7 months pregnant. A group of us had decided to go to the Iroquois Steeplechase in Nashville (if you aren't familiar, it's like a smaller version of the Kentucky Derby), and I was optimistic that I could hang and enjoy myself without getting tired. But after an hour there--hot and surrounded by sweaty, drunk people--I knew I had made a mistake. Being the only sober person at a super-boozy event wasn't fun, plus I was physically uncomfortable just wandering around with everyone, with no place to sit. I wanted no part of it, so I decided to leave. Even though the after-party was held at our house, I was in bed early, perfectly content, while everyone partied the night away.<br><br>Now, pregnant or not, I always try to get plenty of sleep.<br><br>I knew that if I had stayed and pushed myself, I would have been exhausted. And honestly, when I'm tired, I'm awful to be around. There's nothing I hate more than being grumpy and tired. I didn't always know this about myself, but it's one of the best things I figured out during pregnancy. Now, pregnant or not, I always try to get plenty of sleep.<br><br>Similarly, during my first pregnancy, I was traveling a lot for work and got pulled in every direction. I was back and forth to L.A. for shoe and jewelry design meetings. I was working on a pilot for a TV show that I was producing (unfortunately, the show never got picked up). I flew to New York City for paid events and had multiple photo shoots as well. It was too much. So I started saying yes only to jobs that I absolutely wanted to do. Being on planes while pregnant isn't my favorite thing. And overall, I was too tired and wanted to nest at home, so I had to be truly excited about whatever the offer was to accept. This prepared me for the time after having my babies, when I had to be even pickier about which jobs to take.<br><br>Mini-Spa Day at Home<br><br>A home spa day is an easy treat that you can give yourself, pregnant or not. I found it especially helpful in reconnecting with my body, which, during pregnancy, can often feel more like a vessel for a foreign object than a thing to be pampered. Here's what I do.<br><br>1. Enjoy a nice, long bath. You can add a few drops of lavender oil for a relaxing bath or a couple of drops each of peppermint and lemon oil for a pick-me-up. Rose oil is another girly option I love for its beautiful smell. It's also very sensual.<br><br>2. In the bathtub with the bathwater running, exfoliate your face with my "Homemade Coffee Face Scrub" (see the recipe on page 170). Then wipe off the scrub with a washcloth.<br><br>3. Apply a natural face mask (see my recipe for "Homemade Moisturizing Face Mask" on page 168). Leave it on for your time in the bath.<br><br>4. If your hair is dry, apply a coconut oil hydrating mask, then pull your hair back with a hair tie while the mask works its magic (see page 165 for specifics). Make sure to wash your hair before getting out of the tub. Coconut oil is great because one wash and it's gone.<br><br>5. After the bath, moisturize with body oil and whatever moisturizer you like for your face.<br><br>6. All the while, make sure to check yourself out in your bathroom mirror naked. The more time I spend with my naked self, the more I appreciate my body, especially while pregnant. A pregnant body is beautiful!<br><br>7. Give yourself a manicure and pedicure.<br><br>8. Finish the mini-spa with a blow-dry. For me, when my hair looks good, the rest doesn't matter.<br><br>SETTLING INTO PREGNANCY<br><br>Being pregnant gave me a newfound love and respect for my body that I didn't have before. It's a miracle that our bodies are capable of housing a baby for almost 10 months. If you don't feel great in your skin, just consider how spectacular our bodies are. We are able to give the gift of life! How amazing is that? When your belly is protruding so far you can't go 5 minutes without bumping into something, it will be hard to remember that this is a temporary situation (and one you will likely miss when it's gone--like I did!). But trust me, you will have your body back to yourself one day.<br><br>While I loved my pregnant body, especially my belly in the first few months, I started to get self-conscious toward the end. Many physical changes come along with being pregnant, and I found it hard to feel sexy. Besides the obviously expanding belly, my boobs got bigger (that was actually a plus), and I had a couple of pregnancy spots on my face from the sun and little bumps on the backs of my arms and thighs from hormones. Not always so pretty. With our bodies rapidly changing, it's no surprise that most of us need a little reassurance.

But when she makes a wrong turn, she encounters some kids who are up to no good. Fortunately, Hazel's amazing mother is there to rescue her--and set the bullies straight--just in the nick of time.<br><br>"A beguiling book with a nonsensical streak that will make children look again and laugh."--<i>Booklist</i></p><p>A warm, triumphant fantasy about the power of mother love.Born in New York City, Rosemary Wells grew up in a house "filled with books, dogs, and nineteenth-century music." Her childhood years were spent between her parents' home near Red Bank, New Jersey, and her grandmother's rambling stucco house on the Jersey Shore. Most of her sentimental memories, both good and bad, stem from that place and time. Her mother was a dancer in the Russian Ballet, and her father a playwright and actor. Mrs. Wells says, "Both my parents flooded me with books and stories. My grandmother took me on special trips to the theater and museums in New York.<p>When I was two years old I began to draw and they saw right away the career that lay ahead of me and encouraged me every day of my life. As far back as I can remember, I did nothing but draw."</p><p>A self-proclaimed "poor student," Wells attended the Museum School in Boston after finishing high school. It was, she recalls, "a bastion of abstract expressionism an art form that brought to my mind things I don't like to eat, fabrics that itch against the skin, divorce, paper cuts, and metallic noises."</p><p>Without her degree, she left school at 19, married, and began a fledgling career as a book designer with a Boston textbook publisher. When her husband, Tom, applied to the Columbia School of Architecture two years later, the couple moved to New York, where she began her career in children's books working as a designer at Macmillan. It was there that she published her first book, an illustrated edition of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's <i>I Have a Song to Sing-O</i>.</p><p>Rosemary Wells's career as an author and illustrator spans more than 30 years and 60 books. She has won numerous awards, and has given readers such unforgettable characters as Max and Ruby, Noisy Nora, and Yoko. She has also given <i>Mother Goose</i> new life in two enormous, definitive editions, published by Candlewick. Wells wrote and illustrated <i>Unfortunately Harriet</i>, her first book with Dial, in 1972. One year later she wrote the popular <i>Noisy Nora</i>. "The children and our home life have inspired, in part, many of my books. Our West Highland white terrier, Angus, had the shape and expressions to become Benjamin and Tulip, Timothy, and all the other animals I have made up for my stories." Her daughters Victoria and Beezoo were constant inspirations, especially for the now famous "Max" board book series. "Simple incidents from childhood are universal," Wells says. "The dynamics between older and younger siblings are common to all families."</p><p>But not all of Wells' ideas come from within the family circle. Many times when speaking, Mrs. Wells is asked where her ideas come from. She usually answers, "It's a writer's job to have ideas." Sometimes an idea comes from something she reads or hears about, as in the case of her recent book, <i>Mary on Horseback</i>, a story based on the life of Mary Breckenridge, who founded the Frontier Nursing Service. <i>Timothy Goes to School</i> was based on an incident in which her daughter was teased for wearing the wrong clothes to a Christmas concert. Her dogs, west highland terriers, Lucy and Snowy, work their way into her drawings in expression and body position. She admits, "I put into my books all of the things I remember. I am an accomplished eavesdropper in restaurants, trains, and gatherings of any kind. These remembrances are jumbled up and changed because fiction is always more palatable than truth. Memories become more true as they are honed and whittled into characters and stories."</p><p>Mrs. Wells says, "Most of my books use animals rather than children as characters. People always ask why. There are many reasons. First, I draw animals more easily and amusingly than I do children. Animals are broader in range--age, time, and place--than children are. They also can do things in pictures that children cannot. They can be slapstick and still real, rough and still funny, maudlin and still touching.</p><p>In <i>Benjamin and Tulip</i>, Tulip falls out of a tree and mashes Benjamin in the mud. If these pictures were of children, they would be too close to violent reality for comfort, and all the humor would be lost."</p><p>Her writing career has been a "pure delight," she says. "I regret only that I cannot live other lives parallel to my own. Writing is a lonely profession and I am a gregarious sort of person. I would like someday to work for the FBI. A part of me was never satisfied with years of tennis. I still yearned to play basketball."</p></p><h2>Graves&#39; Disease And Hyperthyroidism: What You Must Know Before They Zap Your Thyroid With Radioactive Iodine</h2><p>Graves&#39; disease is one of several causes of hyperthyroidism. In &#34;Graves&#39; Disease And Hyperthyroidism&#34;, Dr. Zaidi, a leading endocrinologist, describes how to accurately diagnose and treat Graves&#39; disease as well as other causes of hyperthyroidism. The medical treatment of Graves&#39; disease has not changed in over 50 years. Sad, but true! The standard, usual treatment with Radioactive iodine is a superficial, myopic approach. It almost always makes you hypothyroid (underactive thyroid state). Then, you need to be on thyroid pills for the rest of your life. In addition, radioactive iodine does not treat the underlying root cause of Graves&#39; disease - autoimmune dysfunction, which continues to smolder and easily erupts into another autoimmune disease. Anti-thyroid drugs do not treat autoimmune dysfunction either. They provide only temporary relief. Often, symptoms return once you stop these drugs. Surgery also does not treat autoimmune dysfunction. It often leads to hypothyroidism as well as many other complications. Over the last ten years, Dr. Zaidi developed a truly breakthrough approach to get rid of Graves&#39; disease at its roots - autoimmune dysfunction. His patients have benefited tremendously from this approach. Now, its time for you to learn about this ground breaking discovery. Dr. Zaidi reveals what really causes autoimmune dysfunction that ultimately leads to Graves&#39; disease. His revolutionary treatment strategy consists of five components: His unique Diet for Graves&#39; disease (including original recipes), the link between Vitamin D deficiency and Graves&#39; disease, the connection between Graves&#39; disease and Vitamin B12 deficiency, how Stress causes Graves&#39; disease (and Dr. Zaidi&#39;s unique strategy to manage stress) and the Judicious use of Anti-Thyroid drugs. Dr. Zaidi also explains: What are thyroid antibodies? What are the tests to diagnose various causes of hyperthyroidism? What causes Graves&#39; eye disease and what is its proper treatment? How do you accurately diagnose and manage Graves&#39; disease during pregnancy?</p><p>Sarfraz Zaidi, MD, FACE, FACP Dr. Sarfraz Zaidi is a leading Endocrinologist in the U.S.A.

Or that pumas can leap over 15 feet into trees? There are roughly 38 species of cats today, each one superbly adapted to their environment - whether that be in the rainforest or the desert!<br><br>This captivating and stunningly illustrated guide will teach you everything you need to know about our feline friends.</p><p>Owen Davey is a freelance illustrator, living and working out of Leicester, UK. He graduated with a First Class Degree in Illustration from Falmouth University and his work has since been published in every continent except Antarctica, including picture books in UK, America, Australia, Germany, France, Portugal, China &amp; Korea. He has also worked for some impressive clients including the New York Times, Microsoft and Orange.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Following Smart About Sharks and Mad About Monkeys, Davey now lends his signature style to the world of cats, large and small. Davey's illustrations and design are phenomenal. Stylized images, done in a color palette of oranges and greens on heavy matte paper, evoke a chic, retro vibe. The artwork is so engaging that the text almost seems secondary, but in fact, a surprising amount of information is stuffed into 40 pages. Davey begins with introductory data such as what cats eat (anything with meat, even turtles and snakes) and basic feline anatomy (this section includes a clever diagram of retracted cat claws). Information gets more detailed and species-specific further on in the book. One memorable spread features a scale diagram of a human next to eight different cats (tigers are huge!). An index provides species nomenclature and world region. The only information that is slightly confusing is a chart of cat lineage. Readers looking for an accurate evolutionary tree may come to the conclusion that pumas are descended from modern tigers because of the layout. Overall, this book is a strong introduction to the cat family that can also serve as a great jumping-off point for further investigation about lesser-known types such as the caracal and jaguarundi. VERDICT A visual feast for all ages, this book melds amazing graphic design with fantastic facts to form a must-have for animal lovers and nonfiction collections.&#x2014;Alyssa Annico, Youngstown State University, OH</p><h2>Ajin 4: Demi-Human (Ajin: Demi-Human)</h2><p>Encourages by a fellow demi-human&#39;s stunt, many more who have been keeping a low profile come out the woodworks.

Who's going to get it out? Mouse says Cow is big, brave, and strong, and must go first. Cow goes in but does not come out. Pig tries next, as Mouse deems him smart, wise, and stinky. Pig takes offense at the "stinky" designation, but proceeds into the doghouse. Pig does not return either. Duck, as the loudest, goes next&#x2014;and disappears just like the others. The only one left outside, Mouse timidly calls out, "Can't you come out, Duck?"&#x2014;upon which Dog appears in the doorway and says, "No! Because I am having duck for dinner." Mouse assumes the worst, but the last spread shows all the animals inside the dog's house sitting down to a meal. Mouse joins the party on the endpapers, just in time for dessert. The simple cartoon characters, scenery, and dialogue balloons are outlined in thick, bold lines. Colors are smooth and flat, with backgrounds done in bright blues, purple, and lime green.

He hates history and loves bacon, rats, and playing tricks on his squeamish older sister. When he opts out of a family weekend trip, he never guesses that he is about to take a terrifying journey into darkness. Hungry demons and howling werewolves haunt his waking nightmares... and threaten his life.</p><p>Darren Shan is the New York Times bestselling author of Cirque Du Freak and The Demonata, whose novels have sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Darren lives in Ireland, where he writes and collects art, comics, and film.<br>Gr. 9-12. Older fans of Shan's gory, gripping Cirque du Freak series will welcome this first book in the Demonata series, which features a similar horrific spin, dark humor, and graphic detail. Grubitsch Grady ("Grubbs" for short) walks into his parents' bedroom to find his mother, father, and older sister torn to pieces by Lord Loss, a powerful demon that feeds on human pain and suffering. Grubbs is attacked by Lord Loss' familiars, marvelously creepy hybrid creatures, and to his great astonishment, he manages to escape. Not surprisingly, he ends up in a mental institution, completely derailed by the horror he has seen and experienced. Eventually, he is taken in by his uncle Dervish, discovers a cousin he never knew, and, alas, learns that lycanthropy runs in the family. The plot rolls along at high speed, but Shan is still quite adept when it comes to capturing Grubbs' roller-coaster emotions--loss and grief and, later, trust. A sneak peek at the second book in the series, <i>Demon Thief,</i> shows Shan continuing in the same vein but with different characters. <i>Debbie Carton</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Unscrupulous Chinese entrepreneurs are flooding world markets with lethal products. China's perverse form of capitalism combines illegal mercantilist and protectionist weapons to pick off American industries, job by job. China's emboldened military is racing towards head-on confrontation with the U.S. Meanwhile, America's executives, politicians, and even academics remain silent about the looming threat.

Inside the United States, Americans are being injured or killed by the Dragon&#x2019;s dangerous exports: poisoned food, spiked drugs, toxic toys.

She has received dozens of awards and accolades, including starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, The New York Journal of Books and Kirkus.&nbsp;<br><br>Kristan lives in Connecticut with her heroic firefighter husband, two atypically affectionate children, a neurotic rescue mutt and an occasionally friendly cat.&nbsp;Jenny<br><br>Today is one of those days when I realize that staying friends with my ex-husband was a huge mistake.<br><br>I'm at the baby shower for Ana-Sofia, Owen's wife and my replacement. Indeed, I'm sitting next to her, a place of honor in this circle of beaming well-wishers, and I'm probably beaming just as hard as everyone else. Harder, even, my "gosh, isn't it wonderful, she's so radiant" smile that I give at work quite often, especially as my brides get bitchier or their mothers get more critical or their maids of honor get more jealous. But this smile, the baby-shower smile...this is superhuman, really.<br><br>I know that coming today is incredibly pathetic, don't worry. It's just that I didn't want to seem bitter by not showing up&#x2014;though I'm pretty sure I <em>am</em> bitter, at least a little. After all, I'm the one who always wanted kids. Every time I brought it up, though, Owen said he wasn't sure the time was right, and he loved our life the way it was.<br><br>Yeah. So. That turned out not to be quite true, but we did stay friends. Coming today, though...pathetic.<br><br>However, I woke up this morning utterly starving, and I knew the food would be amazing at the shower. Ana-Sofia <em>inspires</em> people. Plus, I'm moving out of the city, so for the past three weeks, I've been trying to eat or give away every morsel of food in my apartment. Let's also mention that I couldn't figure out an excuse that people would buy. Better to be an oddity here than Poor Jenny at home, scrounging through a box of Wheat Thins of indeterminate age.<br><br>Ana-Sofia opens my gift, which is wrapped in Christmas paper, despite it being April. Liza, my host, glowers; the red-and-green cocoa-swilling Santas are an affront to the party vibe, which Liza noted on the invitations.<br><br>In an effort to create a beautiful and harmonious environment for Ana-Sofia, please adhere to the apricot-and-sage color scheme in your clothing and gift-wrapping choices.<br><br>Only in Manhattan, folks. I'm wearing a purple dress as a middle finger to Liza, who used to be my friend but now posts daily on Facebook that she's LOLing with her BFF, Ana-Sofia.<br><br>"Oh! This is so lovely! Thank you, Jenny! Everyone, look at this! It's beautiful!" Ana-Sofia holds up my gift, and there are gasps and murmurs and exclamations and a few glares that I have brought the best present. I cock an eyebrow at the haters. <em>Suck it up, bitches.</em> My gift was actually dashed off last night, as I kind of forgot to buy a present, but they don't have to know that.<br><br>It's a white satin baby blanket with leaves and trees and birds stitched into it. Hey. It only took me two hours. Nothing was hand-stitched. It wasn't that big a deal. I sew for a living. A wedding-dress designer. The irony is not lost on me.<br><br>"Couldn't you have just bought a stuffed animal like a normal person?" murmurs the person on my left. Andreas&#x2014;born Andrew&#x2014;my assistant, and the only man here. Gay, of course&#x2014;do straight men work in designer bridal wear? Also, he hates and fears children, which makes him the perfect date for me under the circumstances. I needed an ally.<br><br>Have I mentioned that the shower is being held in the apartment I once shared with Owen? Where, so far as I could tell, he and I were extremely happy? Yes. Liza is hosting, but the power went out in her apartment, thanks to the ham-fisted construction crew installing her new glass countertops&#x2014;granite being so very last decade&#x2014;and so we're here instead. Liza is sweaty and loud, rightfully worried about being judged on her prowess as hostess. This is the Upper East Side, after all. We're all about judgment here.<br><br>The gifts&#x2014;including mine&#x2014;border on the ridiculous. The shower invitation&#x2014;engraved from Crane's&#x2014;asked, at the behest of the parents, for donations to the clean-well-water charity Ana-Sofia founded&#x2014;Gushing...org, the name of which brings to mind a particularly bad menstrual period, but which raises funds for wells in Africa. Yeah. Therefore, everyone donated fat checks <em>and</em> tried to outdo each other with gifts. There's a Calder mobile. A 1918 edition of Mother Goose stories. A mohair Steiff teddy bear that costs about as much as the rent on my soon-to-be former apartment in the Village.<br><br>My gaze drifts across the now-tastefully furnished apartment. When I lived here, it was cozier and boho&#x2014;fat, comfortable furniture; dozens of pictures of my three nieces; the occasional wall hanging from Target, that bastion of color and joy for the middle class. Now the decor is incredibly tasteful, with African masks on the wall to remind us what Ana-Sofia does, and original paintings from around the globe. The walls are painted those boring neutral colors with sexy names&#x2014; October Fog, Birmingham Cream, Icicle.<br><br>There's their wedding photo. They eloped, so thank God I didn't have to go to that&#x2014;or, heaven forbid, make her gown, which I would've done if asked, because I'm still pretty pitiful where Owen is concerned and can't figure out how to divorce him out of my heart. Though the photo was taken by the justice of the peace in Maine, it's perfect. Both bride and groom are laughing, slightly turned away from the camera, Ana's hair blowing in the sea breeze. The <em>New York Times</em> featured the photo in the Sunday Vows section.<br><br>They really are the perfect couple. Once, it was Owen and me, and while I didn't expect perfection, I thought we were pretty great. We never fought. My mom felt that since Owen is half-Japanese, he was a better bet than "those simpletons" I dated&#x2014;all of whom I hoped to marry at one point or another, starting with Nico Stephanopolous in eighth grade. "The Japanese don't believe in divorce," Mom said the first time I introduced her. "Right, Owen?"<br><br>He agreed, and I can still see his omnipresent, sweet smile, the Dr. Perfect Smile, as I called it. It's his resting expression. Very reassuring to his patients, I'm sure. Owen is a plastic surgeon, the kind who fixes cleft palates and birthmarks and changes the lives of his patients. Ana-Sofia, who is from Peru and speaks five languages, met Owen eleven weeks after our divorce when he was doing his annual stint with Doctors Without Borders in the Sudan and she was digging wells.<br><br>And I make wedding dresses, as I believe I've already said. Listen, it's not as shallow as it sounds. I make women look the way they dreamed they would on one of the happiest days of their lives. I make them cry at their own reflections. I give them the dress they've spent years thinking about, the dress they'll be wearing when they pledge their hearts, the dress they'll pass on to their own daughters someday, the dress that signifies all their hopes and dreams for a happy, sparkling future.<br><br>But compared with what Owen and his second wife do, yeah, it's incredibly shallow.<br><br>In theory, I should hate them both. No, he didn't cheat with her. He's far too decent for that.<br><br>He loves her, though. Ostensibly, I could hate him for loving her and not me. Make no mistake. I was heartbroken. But I can't hate Owen, or Ana-Sofia. They're too damn nice, which is incredibly inconsiderate of them.<br><br>And being Owen's friend is better than being without Owen entirely.<br><br>The quilt has made the rounds of admiration and is passed back to Ana. She strokes it tenderly, then looks at me with tears in her eyes. "I don't have the words to tell you how much this means."<br><br><em>Oh, shut up,</em> I want to say. <em>I forgot to buy you a gift and dashed this off last night with some leftover Duchess satin. It's no big deal.</em><br><br>"Hey, no worries," I say. I'm often glib and stupid around Ana-Sofia. Andreas hands me another cream puff. I may have to give him a raise.<br><br>"I'm so excited about your new shop," Ana continues. "Owen and I were talking about how talented you are just last night."<br><br>Andreas gives me a significant look and rolls his eyes. He has no problem hating Ana-Sofia <em>and</em> Owen, which I appreciate. I smile and take another sip of my mimosa, which is made with blood oranges and really good champagne.<br><br>If I'm ever pregnant, though the chances of that are plummeting by the hour, I imagine I'll have the unenviable "I sat on an air hose" look that my sister had when she was percolating the triplets. There was no glow. There was acne. Stretch marks that made her look as if she'd been mauled by a Bengal tiger. She gnashed on Tums and burped constantly, but in true Rachel fashion, my sister never complained.<br><br>Ana-Sofia <em>glows.</em> Her perfect olive skin is without a blemish or, indeed, a visible pore. Her boobs look fantastic, and though she is eight and a half months pregnant, her baby bump is modest and perfectly round. She has no cankles. Life is so unfair.<br><br>"We just found out that our daughter's classmate is her half brother," says the taller woman in Lesbian Couple #1. One of them just became a partner in Owen's practice, but I don't remember her name. "Imagine if we hadn't known that! She could've ended up dating her half brother! Marrying him! The fertility clinic gave out <em>fourteen</em> samples of that donor's sperm. We're filing a lawsuit."<br><br>"It's better than adopting," says another woman. "My sister? She and her husband had to give back their son the fourth time he set fire to the living room."<br><br>"That's not so bad. My cousin adopted, and then the birth mother came out of rehab and the judge gave her custody of the baby. After two years, mind you."<br><br>On the other side of the circle, there seems to be a heated debate over whose labor and delivery was most grueling. "I almost died," one woman says proudly. "I looked at my husband and told him I loved him, and the next thing I knew, the crash cart was there..."<br><br>"I was in labor for three <em>days,"</em> another states. "I was like a wild animal, clawing at the sheets."<br><br>"Emergency cesarean eight weeks early, no anesthesia," someone else says proudly. "My daughter weighed two pounds. NICU, fifty-seven days."<br><br><em>And we have a winner!</em> The other mothers shoot her resentful looks. Talk turns to food allergies, vaccines, family beds and the sad dearth of gifted and talented programs for preschoolers.<br><br>"This is fun," I murmur to Ana-Sofia.<br><br>"Oh, yes," she says. Irony is not one of her skills. "I'm so glad you are here, Jenny. Thank you for giving up your afternoon! You must be very busy with the move."<br><br>"You're moving?" one of her extremely beautiful and well-educated friends asks. "Where?"<br><br>"Cambry-on-Hudson," I answer. "I grew up there. My sister and her family are&#x2014;"<br><br>"Oh, my God, you're leaving Manhattan? Will you have to get a car? Are there any restaurants there? I couldn't live without Zenyasa Yoga."<br><br>"You still go to Zenyasa?" someone says. "I've moved on. It's Bikram Hot for me. I saw Neil Patrick Harris there last week."<br><br>"I don't do yoga anymore," a blonde woman says, studying a raspberry. "I joined a trampoline studio over on Amsterdam. Sarah Jessica Parker told me about it."<br><br>"What about brunch?" someone asks me, her brow wrinkling in concern. "What will you do for brunch if you leave the city?"<br><br>"I think brunch is illegal outside Manhattan," I answer gravely. No one laughs. They may think I'm telling the truth.<br><br>Now, granted, I love Manhattan. To paraphrase the song, if you make it here, the rest of the world is a cakewalk. And I <em>have</em> made it here. I've worked for the best&#x2014;even Vera Wang, as a matter of fact. My work is sold at Kleinfeld Bridal and has supported me for fifteen years. I was named one of the Designers of the Year when I was at Parsons. I've been to not one, but two parties at Tim Gunn's place. He greeted me by name&#x2014;and yes, he's as nice as he seems.<br><br>But while I love the city, its roar, its buildings and smells, its subways and skyline, in my heart of hearts, I want a yard. I want to see my nieces more often. I want the happily-ever-after that my sister nailed, that's unfolding for my ex-husband and his too-nice wife.<br><br>I hope I'm running to something, not away. The truth is work has felt a little flat lately.<br><br>Cambry-on-Hudson is a lovely little city about an hour north of Manhattan. It has several excellent restaurants&#x2014;some even serve brunch, shockingly. The downtown has a movie theater, flowering trees, a park and a Williams-Sonoma. It's hardly a third-world country, no matter what these women think. And the latest shop is Bliss. Custom-made wedding gowns. My baby, in lieu of the human kind.<br><br>My phone beeps softly with a text. It's from Andreas, who has put in his earbuds in order to drown out the stories of blocked milk ducts and bleeding nipples.<br><br>Check out the nose on the great-aunt. I hope the baby inherits that.<br><br>I smile at him gratefully.<br><br>"Did you hear about the obstetrician who fathered fifty-nine babies?" someone asks.<br><br>"That was an episode on <em>Law &amp; Order"</em><br><br>"Ripped from the headlines," someone else murmurs. "Someone in my building was one of his patients."<br><br>"Oh. Oh, dear," Ana-Sofia says.<br><br>I turn to her. She looks a bit startled. "It's probably not true," I tell her.<br><br>"No... I think... It appears my water has broken."<br><br>There is a silence, followed by a collective roar.<br><br>I'll spare you the details. Suffice it to say that, despite there being a dozen women who've given birth all jockeying for position, my hand is the one Ana-Sofia clutches. "Oh, Jenny, it's happening," she says. "I feel something." Her beautiful brown eyes are wide and terrified, and then I'm easing her onto the floor and crouched between her still-slim thighs&#x2014;really, it's like she's showing off. I slide off her thong&#x2014;she's maintained her bikini wax, FYI&#x2014;and, holy Mother of God, I can see the head.<br><br>I fumble in my purse for the travel-size Purell (if you ride the subways on a daily basis, you carry Purell) and slather some on my hands. "Get some towels and quiet down!" I bark at the other shower guests. I'm kind of good in emergencies. Liza hands me a stack of towels&#x2014;very soft and about to be ruined by whatever comes out of a woman during childbirth.<br><br>"Let me help," Liza whines. Indeed, this would make a great Facebook post. Just delivered my BFF's baby, LOL!&#x2014;with Ana-Sofia Marquez-Takahashi.<br><br>"I need to push," Ana pants, and she does, once, twice, a third time, and a face appears&#x2014;a baby! There's a baby coming into my hands! One more push, and I'm holding it, slimy and covered in white gunk and a little blood and incredibly beautiful.<br><br>Dark hair, huge eyes. A miracle.<br><br>I ease her out all the way and put her on Ana's chest. "It's a girl," I say, covering the baby with a towel.<br><br>It seems like just a few seconds later that FDNY clomps in, and I entertain a quick and deeply satisfying fantasy<em>&#x2014;The head firefighter is filled with admiration for my cleverness, checks me out and asks me to dinner in the cutest Brooklyn accent the world has ever heard. His biceps flex hypnotically, and at the end of the date, yes, he does pick me up to demonstrate just how easy it would be for him to save my life, and a few years later, we have three strong sons, twin daughters on the way. And a Dalmatian.</em><br><br>But no, their attention is quite taken with Ana-Sofia&#x2014;as it should be, I guess, though it ...</p><h2>When God Becomes Real</h2><p><p>Panic snuck up on Brian Johnson while he was out with his son, and it clung to him on his desperate drive home. Feeling almost outside of himself, his family called 911. He was spiraling into darkness. Waiting for the ambulance to arrive, unsure of what was happening, he gathered his family around him and asked them to pray for him. Then he said these pivotal words, &#x201c;This is when God becomes real.&#x201d; In his first book, Brian shares how the panic and anxiety of his early life?panic he&#x2019;d thought he&#x2019;d beaten?came back to haunt him. After experiencing debilitating anxiety attacks from the age of 7 into his early adult years, Brian learned how worship ushered in the Presence of God and pushed the panic away.&nbsp;</p><p>Now in his mid-thirties and believing himself free, Brian had a vision for worship in the church, built a successful music label with his wife, and written award-winning songs and albums. He was at the height of his success, and from all appearances, things were better than ever. But in the midst of that success, the ghost of his childhood anxiety returned, stronger than ever, and it pulled Brian into a downward spiral of chaos and darkness.</p><p>In the year that would follow, Brian came to experience the ultimate power of surrendering the panic and chaos to God. Whether or not you&#x2019;ve struggled with panic and anxiety, you&#x2019;ve found yourself in pain, asking God for relief. In&nbsp;<i>When God Becomes Real</i>, Brian shares his vulnerable story of overcoming panic and anxiety. Discover how you might find God, even in your darkest hour.</p></p><p><p>Brian Johnson is a critically-acclaimed worship leader, senior worship Pastor at Bethel church in Redding, California, and the co-founder of Bethel Music. He is a survivor of panic and anxiety disorder, and through his struggle, he&#x2019;s experienced the tangible grace of a comforting God. Together with his wife, Jenn, Brian uses his experiences and his profound belief in a present God to craft intimate and resonate worship songs for the church, both locally and throughout the world. Brian and Jenn make their home in Redding California with their four wonderful children, Haley, T�a, Braden, and Ryder Moses.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Automatic Millionaire Workbook: A Personalized Plan to Live and Finish Rich. . .

As I'm writing this, <b>The Automatic Millionaire</b> is approaching one million copies in print around the world and has been translated into seven languages. I've had the incredible privilege of sharing the ideas of the "Automatic Millionaire Philosophy" on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, NBC's the <i>Today</i> show, CNN's <i>American Morning</i>, and many other television shows. In a very short period many people from all walks of life and income levels have been helped by the simple and powerful message. The success of this little book has been exciting and humbling &#x2014; as I've seen firsthand how great a need there is for simple, actionable coaching on money. My dream with <b>The Automatic Millionaire</b> was to create a book you could read in less than an hour and a half and a plan you could implement in less than sixty minutes. As you'll see, based on many of the success stories of readers in this book, it's clearly working.<br><br>So why write a workbook? Why create a companion guide to <b>The Automatic Millionaire</b><i>?</i> For starters, many of my readers (maybe you) have written to me asking for it. Second, I've written this companion guide to help my readers take the incredibly simple wealth-building plan I laid out in <b>The Automatic Millionaire</b> and bring their knowledge to the next level. Having had the opportunity to coach millions of people around the world on how to live and finish rich, I've seen firsthand that, when people write things out, they learn the material better and follow through on their plans more often.<br><br>My goal with <b>The Automatic Millionaire Workbook</b> is to help you create a simple, complete, step-by-step plan that will make you a millionaire by the time you retire &#x2014; and help you retire earlier than you ever thought possible.<br><br><b>IN FIVE QUESTIONS, I CAN TELL IF YOU'LL BE A MILLIONAIRE</b><br><br>In the past few years, thousands of people have asked me, "David, what's the secret to being rich?" In talking with them, I've discovered that the only difference between millionaires and the people who spend their lives living paycheque to paycheque is this: <b>The millionaires know the strategies that work and follow them.<br><br></b>So I came up with a simple test to find out which people knew the strategies and which ones didn't. Now I can say with confidence:<br><br><b><i>I can ask you five questions and know with 90% accuracy if you'll be a millionaire. </i></b><br><br>It's that simple. The questions are very straightforward; answering all five takes about three minutes. But they reveal everything about your financial prospects.<br><br>The Five Questions:<br>1. Do you know your Latte Factor?<br>2. Do you "Pay Yourself First"?<br>3. Have you made your financial plan automatic?<br>4. Do you own your home?<br>5. Do you tithe?<br><br>If you answer "Yes" to all five questions, based on my experience you've got an <i>excellent</i> opportunity to become a millionaire.<br><br>How do you answer the Five Questions now? How would you like to answer them by the time you're finished with the workbook?<br><br><b>LEARN IT. WRITE IT. LIVE IT.</b><br><br>This book is filled with exercises based on <b>The Automatic Millionaire</b> but taken several steps further. The exercises give you the tools you need to turn the ideas from that book into concrete plans you can put into action today. Every step of the way, I will guide you through the concept; then the exercises will make it personal by showing you how you can apply the concept to your life. Again, I've found from experience &#x2014; both in coaching others and in my own life &#x2014; that, if you write something down, you're much more likely to follow through. I want you to follow through! I've also given you blank pages titled "Brainstorming Breaks," where you can answer some important questions about your finances and your lifestyle in any way you like. Use the "Brainstorming Breaks" as a journal &#x2014; your place to get down on paper the thoughts that are in your head and heart.<br><br>And I will share some real-life success stories from readers who are living the Automatic Millionaire dream. These stories are fantastic teachers. Nothing proves the value of what I'm talking about better than real people talking about how the things they've learned have changed their lives. I hope you enjoy them and they inspire you to take action.<br><br><b>WHO STOLE CANADA&#x2019;S FINANCIAL DREAM?</b><br><br>Once there was a country where people went to work for a company, were paid well, bought a house, raised a couple of kids, and put money into a company retirement plan. If they stayed at the company for thirty or forty years, they retired with a gold watch, a pension, and lived happily ever after.<br><br>Unfortunately, today that Canadian Dream is on life support. Companies are outsourcing and downsizing, the company pension is one of those things we talk about by saying, "Remember when?," and let's not even get started about Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan.<br><br>At the same time as our jobs are becoming more uncertain, we're spending more and saving less. According to Statistics Canada, the median net worth of the top 20 percent of family units in Canada has gone up by 39 percent in real terms over the previous 15 years. The lowest 20 percent has a median net worth of &#x2013;$600. In other words, their debts exceed their assets by $600. The second lowest 20 percent increased their net worth by only $300 over the previous 15 years. Even the supposedly wealthy Baby Boom generation is on shaky financial ground. About 46 percent of unattached Canadians aged 45&#x2013;64 may not have saved enough to retire at 65 and receive two-thirds of their income. About 59 percent who do not own a home may not have saved enough. And about 41 percent of Canadians with pre-retirement incomes of $75,000 or more may not be able to replace at least two-thirds of their pre-retirement incomes.<br><br><b><i>The unfortunate bottom line in Canada is that we often spend everything we earn... and a lot more.</i></b></p><h2>Because of Bethlehem (25-pack)</h2><p>Max Lucado loves Christmas.

Since our culture is in love with immaturity, advice written for &#34;older&#34; women can tend to focus on changes: empty nests, new priorities, grown children getting married, etc. But the Bible tells us to focus on the things that don&#39;t change: In all seasons of life, God has good works prepared in advance for us to walk in. And whether you&#39;re a young woman, married, unmarried, widowed, middle-aged, or a great-grandma, you never quit exercising that faith in Christ. Grandkids and getting older, dinners and hospitality, mentorship and being an &#34;in-law&#34; all come with their own stretches of bumpy road, but faith and joy (and a little of Nancy Wilson&#39;s practical advice) go a long way. Women travelling through this season should be thinking in terms of family legacy -- and in terms of eternity -- as they seek godly wisdom, great joy, and a silver-haired crown of glory.</p><p><b>Nancy Wilson</b> has been a pastor's wife and homemaker in Moscow, Idaho for more than forty years.

Invited to the White House by Candle, the president's lonely only daughter, for the annual Easter Egg hunt and roll, Madeline and the other little girls have a rollicking good time, and introduce Candle to the joys of occasionally breaking the rules. With a bouncy read-aloud text and gorgeous watercolor pictures, Madeline at the White House is in the best tradition of the beloved Madeline books.</p><p><strong>John Bemelmans Marciano on <i>Madeline at the White House</i></strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> Dear Reader, </p> <p> Sending Madeline to the White House is an idea that my grandfather cooked up with his friend, Jacqueline Kennedy. In a series of letters to the First Lady, he imagined a book in which Madeline visits Caroline, or something like that. He even suggested that the Mrs. Kennedy write the words and he would do the pictures. At the time, my grandfather was still working on Madeline and the Magician, a book that he assured her he would finish shortly. </p> <p> Sadly, he never did. My grandfather died in 1962, still at work on the Magician story. The book was to end with Miss Clavel taking in a stray cat who winds up being the Magician in disguise. In what might be one of the last drawings my grandfather ever did, the cat is wearing the magician's fez, surrounded by Madeline and the girls. </p> <p> I've always imagined that picture to be the truth of it--that my grandfather is a kind of magician who has lives on alongside Madeline and her friends. His body itself is buried in Arlington Cemetery. Although born in Europe, my grandfather came to the U.S. as a teenager and proudly served in the army, and always wanted to be buried in a soldier's grave in the nation's capital. </p> <p> For <em>Madeline at the White House</em> I have tried to weave all of these threads together: the book my grandfather never finished, the one he never began, and his feelings for the country he called home. So Madeline goes and visits a little girl named Candle whose father is the busiest man in the world, has fun at the White House Easter Egg Roll, and goes on a magic carpet ride of Washington conducted by a rabbit wearing a fez. </p> <p> I hope you like it. </p> <p> Happy Easter, </p> <p> John Bemelmans Marciano </p>John Bemelmans Marciano carries on the legacy begun by his grandfather, Ludwig Bemelmans, author and illustrator of the Madeline books, with stunning watercolor artwork and playful, energetic storytelling.

Together with a wealth of behind-the-scenes material from its creators&#x2014;including the complete scripts and pencil breakdowns for all four issues&#x2014;ABSOLUTE BATMAN: YEAR ONE offers two distinct versions of the legendary story: Book One features the acclaimed single-volume graphic novel edition with every page newly rescanned and remastered by Mazzucchelli and Lewis from their original boards, while Book Two features the never-before-collected process color edition of the original newsprint comics, sourced from all-new scans made by Mazzucchelli and Lewis from their personal copies of BATMAN #404-407. <br> &nbsp;<br> Originally published over four issues of the monthly BATMAN title in 1986 and 1987, BATMAN: YEAR ONE has gone on to become one of the most popular and influential graphic novels in the history of American comics. Written by Frank Miller and illustrated by David Mazzucchelli with colors by Richmond Lewis, this masterful reimagination of Bruce Wayne&#x2019;s first year as the Dark Knight Detective has electrified generations of readers with its unprecedented fusion of gritty realism and elegance of form.</p><p>Frank Miller began his career in comics in the late 1970s and rose to fame while first drawing, and then writing, <i>Daredevil</i> for Marvel Comics. He was also the creative force behind BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN: YEAR ONE and BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. His many works have not only redefined classic characters, but also, on a few occasions, revitalized the comics industry. His creator-owned <i>Sin City</i> hit the page in 1991, and then the silver screen in 2005--with Miller on board as co-director. His multi-award-winning 300 graphic novel was brought to full-blooded life in the 2007 motion picture of the same name, and in 2008 he directed the feature film of Will Eisner's<i> The Spirit</i>."A gritty and atmospheric retelling of Batman's earliest days, as told by the author of the seminal DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.

Well, that applies to BATMAN: YEAR ONE. It's not only one of the most important comics ever written, it's also among the best." --IGN<br><br>"There's never been storytelling quite like this.

He currently serves as senior pastor and as the network director of Antioch Oasis International. He helps oversee churches nationally and internationally and is known for his gifting in prophetic presbytery and conferences. He and his wife, Diane, have four children and two grandchildren.There will, no doubt, be some that pick this book up read the cover and say, I am familiar with this teaching, it is more of the same. That is far from the truth. The first time I heard Kerry Kirkwood teach I realized he was a man whom, God had entrusted with transforming truth. I begged him to get this into print for the benefit of families and those in market place ministries. If I had another 100 years to live this book would remain in my library. This will be a book that you read and reread, it will be a book you give to family and friends. You will find yourself going back to it for reference. It is a line upon line book. I think we are living in a day when we have a tendency to fix single meaning to truths that we have heard. In doing this we shut our self out from future revelation. This is one of the most timely books I have ever had in my hand, it is a book written by a man of God whose time has come. Faithful men and women will pass this book on to faithful men and women. --Cleddie Keith</p><h2>There Was an Old Dragon Who Swallowed a Knight</h2><p>We all know that &#x201c;there was an old lady&#x201d; who swallowed lots of things. Now meet the old dragon who swallows pretty much an entire kingdom! Will he ever learn a little moderation?! This rollicking rhyme is full to bursting with sight gags, silly characters, and plenty of burps! Parents and kids alike will delight in Ben Mantle&#x2019;s precisely funny illustrations and in Penny Parker Klostermann&#x2019;s wacky rhymes.<br><br>"Klostermann's debut is a rollicking and warped Medieval take on the well-worn cumulative rhyme. Prolific British animator and illustrator Mantle's expressive and bright cartoon illustrations of the red, horned dragon (and the contents of his stomach) are a perfect match. . . . No matter how many swallowed-fly titles you own,&nbsp;this one belongs on your shelf&nbsp;too." - <i>Kirkus</i></p><p>PENNY PARKER KLOSTERMANN loves trout fishing, digging for earthworms, and her sisters! This is her first picture book.<br><br>BEN MANTLE has most recently been working as a children&#x2019;s book illustrator from his shared studio in Brighton, England. He also produces screen prints and digital artwork for exhibition. Ben Mantle has illustrated numerous picture books, including the popular board book <i>Five Little Pumpkins.</i>"No one seems to know why the old dragon swallowed the knight (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not polite!&#x201d;) In addition, the bright red beast proceeds to swallow a steed, a squire, a cook, a lady, a castle, and finally, a moat. At this point the creature decides to burp out everything (except the knight), and what preschooler won&#x2019;t love that! The author has used a broad range of words&#x2014;savory, shady, fattens, tassel, guzzled, bloat, quote, perchance, amass, and billow. These will add depth to the young listener&#x2019;s vocabulary. Mantle&#x2019;s illustrations are full of primary colors and are quite expressive as the dragon gobbles each entity he encounters. Life in the Middle Ages is hinted at with the additional drawings surrounding each dragon tidbit. This will be a great addition to the kindergarten/first grade curriculum on comparing and contrasting similar stories. VERDICT A fine purchase for most collections."<br><br>&#x2013;Elaine Lesh Morgan, formerly at Multnomah County Library, Portland, OR; <i>School Library Journal</i><br>"In days of yore, before a certain fly's ultimately fatal encounter with an Old Lady, there was an old dragon who felt rather peckish. "There was an old dragon who swallowed a knight. / I don't know why he swallowed the knight // It's not polite!" He follows the knight with the knight's steed ("that galloped around at a terrible speed"). Then a squire, a cook, a lady, a castle, and finally a moat are each swallowed in turn. But..."With all of that water, he started to bloat. / And that's when the dragon roared, and I quote: / &#x2018;Okay, enough! I've had enough&#x2014; / More than enough of this swallowing stuff!' " So realizing that eating all those things might have been "a tad impolite," the old dragon burps them all out in reverse except the knight (which is "ahhh...just right"). Klostermann's debut is a rollicking and warped Medieval take on the well-worn cumulative rhyme. Prolific British animator and illustrator Mantle's expressive and bright cartoon illustrations of the red, horned dragon (and the contents of his stomach) are a perfect match. The antics within the dragon's stomach&#x2014;every image of the steed is accompanied by a little "clippity, clippity, clippity, clop" in teeny type&#x2014;and his copious burping will leave 'em laughing. No matter how many swallowed-fly titles you own, this one belongs on your shelf too." &#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i> 4/9/15</p><h2>Military Strategy: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Distilling the ideas of the greatest military theoreticians of history, including Sun Tzu, Niccol� Machiavelli, and Carl von Clausewitz, Antulio J.

After a youth marked by sudden death and loss, Daisy escapes into conventionality as a middle-class wife and mother. Years later she becomes a successful garden columnist and experiences the kind of awakening that thousands of her contemporaries in mid-century yearned for but missed in alcoholism, marital infidelity and bridge clubs. The events of Daisy&#39;s life, however, are less compelling than her rich, vividly described inner life--from her memories of her adoptive mother to her awareness of impending death. Shields&#39; sensuous prose and her deft characterizations make this, her sixth novel, her most successful yet.Who is the real Daisy Goodwill? In this miniaturist masterpiece, Carol Shields pieces together one woman�s story, from its dramatic beginning in a Manitoba kitchen at the turn of the last century to its closing chapter in a Florida hospital in the early nineties. Drifting through the stages of childhood, romance, motherhood, and old age &#x2014; and frequently crowded out of her own history by more flamboyant forebears, friends, and relations &#x2014; Daisy emerges as a twentieth-century Everywoman and her life as a diary of this �mean old sentimental century.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Year in Brambly Hedge: Celebrating forty years of Brambly Hedge with this beautiful storybook gift set</h2><p><p>Celebrate the 30th anniversary of Brambly Hedge with this exquisite slipcase containing the first four classic picture books.</p><p>The mice of Brambly Hedge have many adventures but they always have time for fun too.

After becoming a mother, she founded The Green Baby Chef, a homemade baby food company offering personal chef services for infants, as well as private cooking instruction and baby food-making workshops. She holds a BS in nutrition, food, and agriculture from Cornell University, and an MS and PhD in food science from North Carolina State University.<b>Introduction</b><br> Creating a well-balanced, diverse offering of meals that baby will enjoy can be the most challenging part of feeding your baby. This challenge is largely responsible for why so many parents leave it up to food companies to create and supply their baby&#x2019;s food for them. While commercially processed jarred baby food does offer convenience, homemade baby food made from fresh whole foods is far superior, both in nutrient and flavor quality.&nbsp;<br> Whole foods are foods that are unprocessed and unrefined (or processed and refined as little as possible), and therefore maintain their natural flavor and nutrient integrity. Think of whole foods as those that can typically be found in nature, like whole fruits, vegetables, unrefined grains, and fresh cuts of meat. Processed jarred and pouched baby foods, while made mostly, but not entirely, from whole foods, are subject to very high temperature and pressure treatments, which allow them to remain shelf stable for literally years but result in substantial nutrient and flavor loss. The impact of this high heat can be clearly seen by comparing the color of processed jarred pea puree with homemade pea puree. The dramatic color change that results from excess heat directly indicates nutrient and flavor quality loss. In addition to extensive processing, jarred baby foods often include thickening agents, such as flours, starches, and gums, to increase stability (prevent them from separating during long-term storage), effectively diluting the nutrient density of the product.<br> Homemade baby food, on the other hand, can be prepared using gentle cooking methods, ensuring the maximum retention of nutrient and flavor integrity. Storing homemade baby food in the freezer is a gentle preservation method that locks in nutrients rather than destroying them, allowing this nutrient and flavor integrity to carry over until consumption. When babies are offered gently processed, flavorful whole food purees, they learn to accept and enjoy the natural, beautiful flavors that nature provides. This early acceptance, if cultivated, becomes a preference, and carries on with babies through life. Conversely, the bland flavors of jarred baby food purees often lead to an underdeveloped palate that is less accepting of the full flavors of healthy foods, and that, too, can be carried on through life.<br> Making homemade baby food provides an opportunity for you to prepare whole foods for your baby right from the start. Researchers have found that consumption patterns for fruits and vegetables often change adversely as babies transition from purees to a mature diet, primarily due to the introduction of processed foods. One study researched food consumption patterns of US infants and toddlers and found that, while deep yellow vegetables were consumed by 39 percent of babies at seven to eight months old, that percentage sharply declined to 13 percent at nineteen to twenty-four months old, when french fries became the most commonly consumed vegetable. This study also found that at nineteen to twenty-four months old, nearly one-third of babies consumed no fruit, while 60 percent consumed baked desserts, 20 percent consumed candy, and 44 percent consumed sweetened beverages on a given day.1 In our current Western food culture, many well-intentioned parents unwittingly fall into the processed food trap. And no matter how healthily you may have eaten before you had children, it can be even harder to find the time for fresh-food preparation once they come along. I hope this simple system will make it easier for you to quickly and confidently keep whole foods at the forefront of your child&#x2019;s eating habits&#x2014;even as life becomes increasingly more complex.<br> Preparing homemade baby food is very easy to do, but it does take time, the right cooking tools, and planning to provide a diverse, well-balanced offering of age-appropriate food. The Amazing Make-Ahead Baby Food Book does most of the planning for you, guiding you through a six-step process that will prepare you to make three months&#x2019; worth of baby food in just three one-hour blocks of time. After guiding you through preparing a large supply of individual whole food purees, this book shows you how to combine your individual purees into an endless variation of flavorful, nutritionally balanced meals, and then transitions you to preparing more advanced meals as your baby approaches readiness for a mature diet.<br> As you begin your baby food making adventure be sure to read chapter 2, which provides valuable information on feeding timelines, specific health concerns to be aware of, safe food preparation practices, and selection and preparation tips for whole foods. Please note that this book has been written as an informative guide to support your baby&#x2019;s health and nutrition, but it is not intended as a substitute for the medical advice of a physician. Always consult your baby&#x2019;s pediatrician for health-related matters or concerns.

Brands </b> <br><br> With keen insight and an impeccable sense of the spirit of the times, H. W. Brands, one of today's preeminent historians, captures the American experience through the last six decades. As he chronicles politics, pop culture, and everything in between, Brands traces the changes we have gone through as a nation, recounting the great themes and events that have driven America- from the Yalta conference to the fall of the Berlin Wall, Apollo 11 to 9/11, My Lai to "shock and awe." In his adroit hands, movements and trends unfold through a character- driven narrative that shines a brilliant light on America's watershed moments and reveals a still unfolding legacy of dreams.</p><p><b>H.W. Brands</b> is a professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of the Pulitzer Prize finalists <i>Traitor to His Class</i> and <i>The First American</i>, among others. He lives in Texas.Brands&#x2019; reputation as a prolific author of American history should attract attention to his survey of post-WWII America. With so much material to cover in one volume, Brands must condense events; still, he succeeds in linking a chronicle with important themes to deliver a comprehensible presentation of our country&#x2019;s major political and cultural changes since 1945. The national confidence and social unity of that year, compared with present cultural antagonisms and political polarity, bracket Brands&#x2019; presentation of cold war foreign policy; the civil rights movement; LBJ&#x2019;s escalation in Vietnam and expansion of the welfare state; the collapse of liberalism and rise of conservatism; and American history&#x2019;s directions since 1989. In all this, the baby boomers loom influential in Brands&#x2019; historical appreciation, which weaves in their upbringing in unprecedented prosperity; their questioning of parental attitudes; and their coming to power in the Bill Clinton years. Because his accounts of such social trends are interwoven with those about presidencies up to Barack Obama, Brands delivers a history well modulated for readers seeking an introduction to American history of their living memory. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>The Moynihan Report: The Negro Family - The Case for National Action</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The fundamental problem... is that of family structure. The evidence&#x2014;not final but powerfully persuasive&#x2014;is that the Negro family in the urban ghettos is crumbling.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;From the introduction to <em>The Moynihan Report</em>, 1965</p><p>Against the backdrop of President Johnson&#x2019;s War on Poverty and the Watts riots in Los Angeles, a young civil servant with the OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH at the Department of Labor, DANIEL P. MOYNIHAN, wrote in 1965 his most controversial study <em>The Moynihan Report&#x2014;The Negro Family: The Case for National Action</em>.</p><p>This report drew widespread attention from critics and supporters alike. It concluded that the conditions under which black children were being raised, generally in single-mother households, were the leading cause of black poverty. &nbsp;As Moynihan wrote decades later: &#x201c;The work began in the most orthodox setting, to establish at some level of statistical conciseness what 'everyone knew': that economic conditions determine social conditions. Whereupon, it turned out that what everyone knew was evidently not so."</p><p>Although Moynihan was a liberal politician and the report called for jobs programs and vocational training for blacks, many black and civil rights leaders found his report patronizing and that it relied on stereotypes of the black family and black men. The 1965 statistics, when approximately 25 percent of black babies were born out of wedlock, have not improved 50 years later, when this percentage has grown to 75 percent&#x2014;with 50 percent for Hispanic babies and 29 percent for white babies. Also in other areas, such as income, employment, and incarceration, the statistics have deteriorated for blacks. The legacy of <em>The Moynihan Report</em>&nbsp;is that the debate it launched around cultural causes of black poverty is still not settled in modern day America.</p></p><p>DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN (1927-2003), had an influential career as a liberal Democratic politician, diplomat, and sociologist. He served as Assistant Secretary of Labor under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; he was an adviser to the Republican President Nixon and Ambassador to India and to the United Nations. He ended his career as Senator of New York (1977-2001).

Couples are spending 200 plus hours preparing for a marriage ceremony that is over in a matter of hours and does not prepare them for a lifetime together.This book is about preparing the couple whether it is a first time marriage, intercultural or interracial, or remarriage for a relationship that will stand the test of time through foundation building. There are a lot of good marriage books and marriage preparation books.This is not a content book that one reads one time. It is a workbook that is best utilized with marriage mentors. It asks questions that most books do not ask and that couples do not think of asking one another. It addresses postmarital which is rare. It addresses remarriage after divorce, remarriage after the death of a spouse and when seniors remarry. It addresses intercultural and interracial marriages. It has many practical helps in appendices and it has a counselor s guide section. It is an all in one volume that is not overwhelming in size. The six premarital chapters cover the major areas of married life and are followed through via postmarital in the first year of marriage when the highest incidents of divorce occur. It is built upon training the average lay couple sitting in the local church with years of a good marriage under their belt and puts them to work providing marriage mentoring (rather than a busy and difficult to get to pastor).Who of us would not have benefited from marriage mentoring on our way up the alter and then in that tumultuous first year of adjustment? It is an equipping tool and it helps to provide a form of accountability for the marriage mentors as well as the couple being counseled. There is a theme in the book that starts in chapter one in which each individual has a life call, a life mission. This builds by the couple identifying why God is calling them together their marriage call/mission. This is a missing ingredient in most marriages today - a mission as a couple. This couple will actually write their marriage mission statement and then rewrite it in postmarital. Couples are going to marry all over the world. Marriage is not Christian, it is a creation act of God it predates Christianity. We want to help couples prepare and then stay together through the glue of the Holy Spirit by helping them to identify and fulfill their marriage mission like Adam and Eve had in the garden.</p></p><p>Asks the difficult questions that all couples must answer before and after they say &#34;I do&#34;Steve and Mary Prokopchak have been married for more than 30 years.

Frank, revealing, touching--DAYS OF GRACE is the story of a man felled to soon. It remains as his legacy to us all....<br>AN ALTERNATE SELECTION OF THE BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB</p><p>Before reading this book I was aware of Arthur Ashe as only the tennis commentator that got AIDS, but after finishing DAYS OF GRACE, I realized that he was a truely influential figure, and not just in the previously white world of tennis. As an energetic and unselfish crusader for racial and social justice and as a mouthpiece on AIDS issues, this book will show you what an amzing person Ashe was. The world is a worse off place without him in it.<br><br>The conclusion of the book, where Ashe writes a letter to his daughter in anticipation of his death, should move even the most cold-hearted of people to tears. It's a shame that there can be no follow up, because I'm sure if Ashe had lived, his actions and thought would've been more than worthy enough to fill another book . <br><br>Living in New York, the site of the US Open, has showed me that Ashe's legacy lives on. The charitable works that continue in his name, especially those surrounding the US Open, are a testament to Ashe and to the people who, like him, are committed to a cause. DAYS OF GRACE is not just a memoir by a sports figure, it's a book that teaches us how we might live our lives.<b>Arthur Ashe</b> (1943&#x2013;1993) was a tennis champion, AIDS activist, and tireless crusader for racial and social justice. He was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985&nbsp;and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.<br><br><b>Arnold Rampersad,</b>&nbsp;the Sarah Hart Kimball Professor Emeritus in the Humanities at Stanford University, has also taught at Princeton, Columbia, and Rutgers Universities. His books include&nbsp;<i>The Life of Langston Hughes&nbsp;</i>(two volumes); biographies of W. E. B. Du Bois, Jackie Robinson, and Ralph Ellison; and, with Arthur Ashe,&nbsp;<i>Days of Grace: A Memoir.</i>&nbsp;Among his numerous awards and honors are a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1991 and the National Humanities Medal, presented at the White House in 2011.</p><h2>The Ultimate Fly-Fishing Guide to the Great Smoky Mountains</h2><p><i>The Ultimate Fly-Fishing Guide to the Smoky Mountains</i> does more than any other book in print to bring success to a fishing trip.

She lives with her husband and daughter.1<br><br>Friday, January 13, 2017<br><br>London, 12:30 p.m.<br><br>She must be mistaken, but it looks exactly as if someone is moving into her house.<br><br>The van is parked halfway down Trinity Avenue, its square mouth agape, a large piece of furniture sliding down the ribbed metal tongue. Fi watches, squinting into the buttery sunlight-rare for the time of year, a gift-as the object is borne shoulder high by two men through the gate and down the path.<br><br><i>My gate. My path.</i><br><br>No, that's illogical; of course it can't be her house. It must be the Reeces', two down from hers; they put their place on the market in the autumn and no one is quite sure whether a sale has gone through. The houses on this side of Trinity Avenue are all built the same-redbrick double-fronted Edwardians in pairs, their owners united in a preference for front doors painted black-and everyone agrees it's easy to miscount.<br><br>Once, when Bram came stumbling home from one of his "quick" drinks at the Two Brewers, he went to the wrong door and she heard through the open bedroom window the scrambling and huffing as her inebriated husband failed to fit his key into the lock of number 87, Merle and Adrian's place. His persistence was staggering, his dogged belief that if he only kept on trying, the key <i>would</i> work.<br><br>"But they all look the same," he'd protested in the morning.<br><br>"The houses, yes, but even a drunk couldn't miss the magnolia," Fi had told him, laughing. (This was back when she was still amused by his inebriety and not filled with sadness-or disdain, depending on her mood.)<br><br>Her step falters: the magnolia. It's a landmark, their tree, a celebrated sight when in blossom and beautiful even when bare, as it is now, the outer twigs etched into the sky with an artist's flair. And it is definitely in the front garden of the house with the van outside.<br><br><i>Think.</i> It must be a delivery, something for Bram that he hasn't mentioned to her. Not every detail gets communicated; they both accept that their new system isn't flawless. Hurrying again, using her fingers as a sun visor, she's near enough to be able to read the lettering on the side of the vehicle: prestige home removals. It is a house move, then. Friends of Bram must be dropping something off en route to somewhere. If she were able to choose, it would be an old piano for the boys (please, Lord, not a drum kit).<br><br>But wait-the deliverymen have reappeared and now more items are being transported from van to house: a dining chair; a large, round metallic tray; a box labeled fragile; a small, slim wardrobe the size of a coffin. <i>Whose things are these?</i> A rush of anger fires her blood as she reaches the only possible conclusion: Bram has invited someone to stay. Some dispossessed drinking pal, no doubt, with nowhere else to go. ("Stay as long as you like, mate-we've got tons of room.") When the hell was he going to tell her? Well, there's no way a stranger is sharing their home, however temporarily, however charitable Bram's intentions. The kids come first: Isn't that the point?<br><br>Lately, she worries they've forgotten the point.<br><br>She's almost there. As she passes number 87, she's aware of Merle at the first-floor window, face cast in a frown, arm raised for her attention. Fi makes only the briefest of acknowledgments as she strides through her own gate and onto the tiled path.<br><br>"Excuse me. What's going on here?" But in the clamor no one seems to hear. Louder now, sharper: "What are you doing with all this stuff? Where's Bram?"<br><br>A woman she doesn't know comes out of the house and stands on the doorstep, smiling. "Hello, can I help?"<br><br>She gasps as if at an apparition. This is Bram's friend in need? Familiar by type rather than feature, she is one of Fi's own-though younger, in her thirties-blond and brisk and cheerful, the sort to roll up her sleeves and take charge. The sort, as history testifies, to constrain a free spirit like Bram. "I hope so, yes. I'm Fi, Bram's wife. What's going on here? Are you . . . are you a friend of his?"<br><br>The woman steps closer, purposeful, polite. "Sorry. Whose wife?"<br><br>"Bram's. I mean ex-wife, really." The correction earns a curious look, followed by the suggestion that the two of them move off the path and out of the way of "the guys." As a huge Bubble Wrapped canvas glides by, Fi allows herself to be steered under the ribs of the magnolia. "What on earth has he agreed to here?" she demands. "Whatever it is, I know nothing about it."<br><br>"I'm not sure what you mean." There is a faint puckering of the woman's forehead as she studies Fi. Her eyes are golden brown and honest. "Are you a neighbor?"<br><br>"No, of course not." Fi is becoming impatient. "I live here."<br><br>The puckering deepens. "I don't think so. We're just moving in. My husband will be here soon with the second van. We're the Vaughans?" She says it as though Fi might have heard of them, even offers her hand for a formal shake. "I'm Lucy."<br><br>Gaping, Fi struggles to trust her ears, the false messages they are transmitting to her brain. "Look, I'm the owner of this house, and I think I would know if I'd arranged to rent it out."<br><br>The rose-pink of confusion creeps over Lucy Vaughan's face. She lowers her hand. "We're not <i>renting</i> it. We've <i>bought</i> it."<br><br>"Don't be ridiculous!"<br><br>"I'm not!" The other woman glances at her watch. "Officially, we became the new owners at twelve o'clock, but the agent let us pick up the keys just before that."<br><br>"What are you talking about? What agent? No agent has keys to my house!" Fi's face spasms with conflicting emotions: fear; frustration; anger; even a dark, grudging amusement, because this must be a joke, albeit on an epic scale. What else can it be? "Is this some sort of prank?" She searches over the woman's shoulder for cameras, for a phone recording her bewilderment in the name of entertainment, but finds none-only a series of large boxes sailing past. "Because I'm not finding it very funny. You need to get these people to stop."<br><br>"I have no intention of getting them to stop," Lucy Vaughan says, crisp and decisive, just like Fi usually is when she hasn't been blindsided by something like<i> this</i>. Lucy's mouth turns in vexation before opening in sudden wonder. "Wait a minute. Fi, did you say? Is that Fiona?"<br><br>"Yes. Fiona Lawson."<br><br>"Then you must be-" Lucy pauses, notices the querying glances from the movers, lowers her voice. "I think you'd better come inside."<br><br>And Fi finds herself being ushered through her own door, into her own house, like a guest. She steps into the broad, high-ceilinged hallway and stops short, dumbstruck. This isn't <i>her</i> hall. The dimensions are correct, yes; the silver-blue paint scheme remains the same and the staircase has not moved; but the space has been stripped, plundered of every last item that belongs in it: the console table and antique monks bench, the heap of shoes and bags, the pictures on the walls. And her beloved rosewood mirror, inherited from her grandmother, gone! She reaches to touch the wall where it should be, as if expecting to find it sunk into the plaster.<br><br>"What have you done with all our things?" she demands of Lucy. Panic makes her strident and a passing mover casts her a correcting sort of look, as if <i>she</i> is the threatening one.<br><br>"I haven't done anything," Lucy says. "You moved your stuff out. Yesterday, I'm assuming."<br><br>"I did nothing of the sort. I need to look upstairs," Fi says, shouldering past her.<br><br>"Well . . ." Lucy begins, but it isn't a request. Fi isn't seeking permission to inspect her own home.<br><br>Having climbed the stairs two at a time, she pauses on the upstairs landing, hand still gripping the mahogany curve of the banister rail as if she expects the building to pitch and roll beneath her. She needs to prove to herself that she is in the right house, that she hasn't lost her mind. Good, all doors appear to lead to where they should: two bathrooms at the middle front and rear, two bedrooms on the left and two on the right. Even as she lets go of the banister and enters each room in turn, she still expects to see her family's possessions where they should be, where they've always been.<br><br>But there is nothing. Everything they own has vanished, not a stick of furniture left, only indentations in the carpet where twenty-four hours ago the legs of beds and bookcases and wardrobes stood. A bright green stain on the carpet in one of the boys' rooms from a ball of slime that broke open during a fight one birthday. In the corner of the kids' shower stands a tube of gel, the one with tea-tree oil-she remembers buying it at Sainsbury's. Behind the bath taps her fingers find the recently cracked tile (cause of breakage never established) and she presses until it hurts, checking she is still flesh and bone, nerve endings intact.<br><br>Everywhere, there is the sharp lemon smell of cleaning fluids.<br><br>Returning downstairs, she doesn't know whether the ache has its source inside her or in the walls of her stripped house.<br><br>At her approach, Lucy disbands a conference with two of the movers and Fi senses she has rejected their offer of help-to deal with her, the intruder. "Mrs. Lawson? Fiona?"<br><br>"This is unbelievable," Fi says, repeating the word, the only one that will do. Disbelief is all that's stopping her from hyperventilating, tipping into hysteria. "I don't understand this. Please, can you explain what the hell is going on here?"<br><br>"That's what I've been trying to do. Maybe if you see the evidence," Lucy suggests. "Come into the kitchen-we're blocking the way here."<br><br>The kitchen too is bare but for a table and chairs Fi has never seen before, and an open box of tea things on the worktop. Lucy is thoughtful enough to push the door to so as not to offend her visitor's eyes with the sight of the continuing invasion beyond.<br><br><i>Visitor.</i><br><br>"Look at these e-mails," Lucy says, offering Fi her phone. "They're from our solicitor, Emma Gilchrist at Bennett, Stafford and Co."<br><br>Fi takes the phone and orders her eyes to focus. The first e-mail is from seven days ago and appears to confirm the exchange of contracts on 91 Trinity Avenue, Alder Rise, between David and Lucy Vaughan and Abraham and Fiona Lawson. The second is from this morning and announces the completion of the sale.<br><br>"You called him Bram, didn't you?" Lucy says. "That's why it took me a minute to realize. Bram's short for Abraham, of course." She has a real letter at hand too, an opening statement of account from British Gas, addressed to the Vaughans at Trinity Avenue. "We set up all the utility bills to be paperless, but for some reason they sent this by post."<br><br>Fi returns the phone to her. "All of this means nothing. They could be fakes. Phishing or something."<br><br>"Phishing?"<br><br>"Yes, we had a whole talk about neighborhood crime a few months ago at Merle's house and the officer told us all about it. Fake e-mails and invoices look very convincing now. Even the experts can be taken in."<br><br>Lucy gives an exasperated half smile.<br><br>"They're real, I promise you. It's all real. The funds will have been transferred to your account by now."<br><br>"What funds?"<br><br>"The money we paid for this house! I'm sorry, but I can't go on repeating this, Mrs. Lawson."<br><br>"I'm not asking you to," Fi snaps. "I'm<i> telling</i> you-you must have made a mistake. I'm <i>telling</i> you it's not possible for you to have bought a house that was never for sale."<br><br>"But it was for sale-of course it was. Otherwise, we could never have bought it."<br><br>Fi stares at Lucy, utterly disoriented. What she is saying, what she is <i>doing</i>, is complete lunacy and yet she doesn't <i>look</i> like a madwoman. No, Lucy looks like a woman convinced that the person she is talking to is the deranged one.<br><br>"Maybe you ought to phone your husband," Lucy says finally.<br><br>Geneva, 1:30 p.m.<br><br>He lies on the bed in his hotel room, arms and legs twitching. The mattress is a good one, designed to absorb sleeplessness, passion, deepest nightmare, but it fails to ease agitation like his. Not even the two antidepressants he's taken have subdued him.<br><br>Perhaps it's the planes making him crazy, the pitiless way they grind in and out, one after another, groaning under their own weight. More likely it's the terror of what he's done, the dawning understanding of all that he's sacrificed.<br><br>Because it's real now. The Swiss clock has struck. One thirty here, twelve thirty in London. He is now in body what he has been in his mind for weeks: a fugitive, a man cast adrift by his own hand. He realizes that he's been hoping there'll be, in some bleak way, relief, but now the time has come there is something bleaker: none. Only the same sickening brew of emotions he's felt since leaving the house early this morning, somehow both grimly fatalistic and wired for survival.<br><br><i>Oh, God. Oh, Fi. Does she know yet? Someone will have seen, surely? Someone will have phoned her with the news. She might even be on her way to the house already.</i><br><br>He shuffles upright, his back against the headboard, and tries to find a focus in the room. The armchair is red leatherette, the desk black veneer. A return to a 1980s aesthetic, more unsettling than it has any right to be. He swings his legs over the side of the bed. The flooring is warm on bare feet-vinyl or something else man-made. Fi would know what the material is; she has a passion for interiors.<br><br>The thought causes a spasm of pain, a new breathlessness. He rises, seeking air-the room, on the fifth floor, is ablaze with central heating-but behind the complicated curtain arrangement the windows are sealed. Cars, white and black and silver, streak along the carriageways between hotel and airport, and, beyond, the mountains divide and shelter, their white peaks tinged peppermint blue. Trapped, he turns once more to face the room, thinking, unexpectedly, of his father. His fingers reach for the red leatherette chair, grip the seat back. He does not remember the name of this hotel, which he chose for its nearness to the airport, but knows that it is as soulless a place as he deserves.<br><br>Because he's sold his soul, that's what he's done. He's sold his soul.<br><br>But not so long ago that he's forgotten how it feels to have one.</p><h2>The Legend of Saint Nicholas (Incredible Lives for Young Readers)</h2><p><i>A beautiful retelling of the life of Saint Nicholas</i><br><br> Many stories are told about Saint Nicholas -- stories about his generosity and his miracles, stories about the concern he showed for those in poverty.

The pair descend via a submersible into the twilight, the midnight, the abyssal, and, finally, the seldom-seen Hadal zone inside the Mariana Trench (nearly seven miles deep). At each level, the text describes how the children feel (the water pressure increasing as they scuba dive down to 100 feet) and what they see (meticulously labeled specimens, such as the sperm whale, the pink vent eelpout, the strawberry squid, and the tripod fish). Puybaret's illustrations, painted in vivid acrylics, are superbly detailed and visually intriguing. The artwork is so precise that detail-oriented viewers won't miss photographs.

It is among the most searching, self-critical books in all of literature about what Nelson Mandela called the long walk to freedom. Its message is that there is no shortcut to liberty. Numbers is not an easy book to read, nor is it an optimistic one. It is a sober warning set in the midst of a text the Hebrew Bible that remains the West s master narrative of hope. <br>The Mosaic books, especially Exodus and Numbers, are about the journey from slavery to freedom and from oppression to law-governed liberty. On the map, the distance from Egypt to the Promised Land is not far. But the message of Numbers is that it always takes longer than you think. For the journey is not just physical, a walk across the desert. It is psychological, moral, and spiritual. It takes as long as the time needed for human beings to change.... You cannot arrive at freedom merely by escaping from slavery. It is won only when a nation takes upon itself the responsibilities of self-restraint, courage, and patience. Without that, a journey of a few hundred miles can take forty years. Even then, it has only just begun.</p><p>Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks is one of the world s leading Jewish thinkers and moral voices of our time.

His own.</h2><p><b>From David Carr (1956&#x2013;2015), the &#x201c;undeniably brilliant and dogged journalist&#x201d; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>) and author of the instant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> called &#x201c;a compelling tale of drug abuse, despair, and, finally, hope.&#x201d;</b><br><br>Do we remember only the stories we can live with? The ones that make us look good in the rearview mirror? In <i>The Night of the Gun</i>, David Carr redefines memoir with the revelatory story of his years as an addict and chronicles his journey from crack-house regular to regular columnist for<i> The New York Times</i>. Built on sixty videotaped interviews, legal and medical records, and three years of reporting, <i>The Night of the Gun</i> is a ferocious tale that uses the tools of journalism to fact-check the past. Carr&#x2019;s investigation of his own history reveals that his odyssey through addiction, recovery, cancer, and life as a single parent was far more harrowing&#x2014;and, in the end, more miraculous&#x2014;than he allowed himself to remember.<br> <br> Fierce, gritty, and remarkable, <i>The Night of the Gun</i> is &#x201c;an odyssey you&#x2019;ll find hard to forget&#x201d; (<i>People</i>).</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, August 2008</b>: In his fabulously entertaining <i>The Kid Stays in the Picture</i>, legendary Hollywood producer Robert Evans wrote: "There are three sides to every story: yours, mine, and the truth." David Carr's riveting debut memoir, <i>The Night of the Gun</i>, takes this theory to the extreme, as the <i>New York Times</i> reporter embarks on a three-year fact-finding mission to revisit his harrowing past as a drug addict and discovers that the search for answers can reveal many versions of the truth. Carr acknowledges that you can't write a my-life-as-an-addict story without the recent memoir scandals of James Frey and others weighing you down, but he regains the reader's trust by relying on his reporting skills to conduct dozens of often uncomfortable interviews with old party buddies, cops, and ex-girlfriends and follow an endless paper trail of legal and medical records, mug shots, and rejection letters. The kaleidoscopic narrative follows Carr through failed relationships and botched jobs, in and out of rehab and all manner of unsavory places in between, with cameos from the likes of Tom Arnold, Jayson Blair, and Barbara Bush. Admittedly, it's hard to love David Carr--sometimes you barely like the guy. How can you feel sympathy for a man who was smoking crack with his pregnant girlfriend when her water broke? But plenty of dark humor rushes through the book, and knowing that this troubled man will make it--will survive addiction, fight cancer, raise his twin girls--makes you want to stick around for the full 400-page journey. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i>David Carr was a reporter and the &#x201c;Media&nbsp;Equation&#x201d; columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>.&nbsp;Previously, he wrote for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and <i>New York </i>magazine and was editor of the <i>Twin Cities Reader</i> in Minneapolis.&nbsp;The author of the acclaimed memoir, <i>The Night of the Gun</i>, he passed away in February 2015.</p><h2>The Last Dogs: Dark Waters (The Last Dogs, 2)</h2><p>When canine heroes Max, Rocky, and Gizmo encounter a lavish riverboat moored close to shore, they're wary of what they might find on board.

His studio is located in Rochester, New York.Gr 4-8-In this sci-fi/fantasy tale, almost all humans have left for an unknown place. They have abandoned their pets, suspecting that they have a virus that is deadly to people but not animals. In this sequel to The Vanishing (Little, Brown, 2012), three dogs-Max, Gizmo, and Rocky-have become friends and agree to search for their humans rather than remain in the chaos that now exists. As they struggle to find food and safety and avoid dangerous packs of canines and wolves, they slowly start to learn more about the mysterious virus and the laboratory animals that, through experimentation, can now understand human speech. Gizmo is a feisty yet thoughtful Yorkie; Rocky, a Dachshund, provides comic relief as he dreams of kibbles; and Max is a resourceful and brave Lab. The vicious villains, both human and four-legged, are relentless as they pursue the three companions and also threaten other dogs that befriend the trio on their journey. There is a lot happening in this tale and many loose ends are left dangling, perhaps too many for some readers. However, those who are invested in the saga will look forward to the next adventure. The dogs keep the story fun and interesting with their engaging personalities, and this volume can stand on its own.-Carol Schene, formerly at Taunton Public Schools, MA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Brimming with details and earthy vibrance, they are more than up to the task of carrying the story visually. The garden setting also lends itself to some "seek and find" moments, when young readers will be looking closely to spot the gardener among the flora. It&#x2019;s a little story about some pretty big emotions: persistence, dedication, and love. It&#x2019;s also a book that might make you cry happy tears during story time. A beauty.<br> Scope Notes, Best New Book<br><br>[...] charming, immeasurably sweet [...] Hughes&#x2019;s illustrations, vibrant and deeply alive, capture that strange tapestry of tenderness and wilderness of which the human soul is woven. [...] a heartwarming delight in its entirety [...]<br> Scope Notes, Best New Book<br><br>The Little Gardener by Emily Hughes is a miracle of a picture book. Its stunning lush, rough, almost jagged, illustrations paired with a simple, striking narrative holds an incredible power to focus its readers onto this single story and let the rest of the world fade away.<br>&#x2014;The Picture Book Review<br><br>The Little Gardner is different from Wild on the surface, but it still shows the affinity children have with nature and wild things. [...] This story subtly validates the experience of failure while keeping a sense of hope blooming. I&#x2019;m very impressed at how Hughes addresses the deep feelings of insecurity children have. In The Little Gardner, she shows how the efforts little ones make, even if they don&#x2019;t entirely succeed, inspire those bigger than they are. In The Little Gardner, she shows how befriending nature and tending to a garden keeps hope in your heart.<br>&#x2014;Joy Corcoran<br><br>The images are evocative and gorgeous, reminding me of Maurice Sendak in terms of shapes and color choices. Wild and moving that will enthrall readers young and old as they explore the garden of the littlest gardener and see what he created in this world around him.<br>&#x2014;Andrew Shuping, Musing Librarian Reviews<br><br>"Have you ever opened a book and just felt mesmerized by the art and attention to detail? Emily Hughes gorgeously illustrated children&#x2019;s books are precisely that. They are simple stories completely elevated by her distinctive, detailed artwork. There&#x2019;s so much of story-telling and setting of the scene that are hidden in the detail of her illustration. The words are sparse and only a few making it easy for new readers to absorb the essence of the story without feeling overwhelmed. When I re-read her books, I was able to glean even more nuance and rich detail captured in her drawings. The illustrations are so wonderfully vivid that I would totally love to have some of the spreads framed and hung on my wall."<br>&#x2014;Varsha Ravi,&nbsp;<i>Between Bookends&nbsp;</i></p><h2>God and the Afterlife: The Groundbreaking New Evidence for God and Near-Death Experience</h2><p><p>Based on the largest near-death experience study in history, involving 3,000 people from diverse backgrounds and religious traditions, including nonbelievers, <em>God and the Afterlife</em> presents startling evidence that a Supreme Being exists&#x2014;and there is amazing consistency about what he is like.</p><p>In his bestselling book <em>Evidence of the Afterlife</em>, Dr. Jefferey Long showed us that there is a strong scientific case for life after death.

May I have another?</i><br><br>It's been five years since Mapes last graced the "New Release" rack down at the local bookstore with the suspense-filled,&nbsp;<i>Sky Zone</i>. Fortunately, for drooling fans such as myself, he's returned in 2019 with&nbsp;<i>Signs of Life</i>. FYI, you better pack a lunch. Once you enter Mapes' world, you ain't going anywhere. Not for a while, anyway.<br><br>With his thumb placed firmly on the pulse of today's culture, Mapes' fictional story could have been ripped straight from recent headlines -- another crazed, video game-addicted teenage nutcase goes on a shooting rampage. His parents are horrified. The community -- outraged. But a dumbass like Rogan Sneed couldn't possibly have planned and pulled off this diabolical deed on his own -- could he? It's up to Portland PD detective Wayne Deetz to unravel the convoluted case.<br><br>Clutching the same fine-tipped Sharpee he's used consistently in the past to draw vivid portraits of compelling characters, Mapes once again makes us care about his current cast. We may not like them all, but he succeeds in making us care about them.&nbsp;Not only gunman, Sneed, but also Darren Rosco, the big, gruff Portland PD captain with bad teeth, a bad beard, a bad haircut and bad breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp;<i>Signs of Life</i>&nbsp;narrative darts back and forth between Deetz's frustrating investigation and the conflicted story of Tyson Cooper -- a grief-stricken, vengeful, 40-year-old school teacher who lost his wife during the Pioneer Square tragedy of May 7, 2018.

The musician answers, "The most beautiful sound is the sound of <i>ma</i>, of silence."<br>But Yoshio lives in Tokyo, Japan: a giant, noisy, busy city. He hears shoes squishing through puddles, trains whooshing, cars beeping, and families laughing. Tokyo is like a symphony hall!<br>Where is silence?<br>Join Yoshio on his journey through the hustle and bustle of the city to find the most beautiful sound of all.</p><p>Katrina Goldsaito's favorite sound is the sound of bare feet on tatami mats. In Tokyo, she worked as an on-camera TV journalist and producer for NHK-World, and has written for National Geographic, <i>The</i> <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, NPR, and <i>The Japan Times</i>. She lives near Golden Gate Park with her husband and son, and spends her days eating avocados and working on her first YA novel.<br>Julia Kuo's favorite sound is <i>kuk-kuk-kuk</i> (the sound an angry squirrel makes). She is the illustrator of <i>Go, Little Green Truck</i> and has created illustrations for American Greetings, the Cleveland Public Library, <i>The New York Times</i>, and Capitol Records, among many others. She works from Chicago for most of the year, and from Taipei over the winter.K-Gr 4&#x2014;On a rainy, bustling morning in Tokyo, a young boy is surrounded by a symphony of sounds: boots squishing, raindrops pattering, cars rushing, and, to his delight, a koto player producing a range of high, low, and "twangy and twinkling" notes as she tunes her instrument. When Yoshio asks the musician what her favorite sound is, she answers, "Ma," the silence between sounds. Intrigued by her comment, the boy spends his day in search of the elusive ma. Kuo's art provides the backdrop for the child's quest in scenes of contemporary Tokyo, from the high-speed Shinkansen trains that pass through its stations ("whoosh") to the bamboo grove near the school playground that whispers "takeh-takeh-taheh." Most of the images (in pen, with color added digitally) span spreads, offering wide-angle views of the city, but there are a few single-page pictures, proffering their own unique perspectives. The art is rich in detail and features a variety of concentrated colors that give way to muted grays and browns when suddenly, while reading, Yoshi experiences ma, something that feels peaceful, "still inside him." In an author's note, Goldsaito acknowledges the influence of the Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, who believed that "without silence, sound would be meaningless." VERDICT This book will be especially welcome in settings that teach yoga or mindfulness, but its message and striking art will be appreciated anywhere the din of daily life can overwhelm.&#x2014;Daryl Grabarek, School Library Journal</p><h2>SERIOUS CALL TO A DEVOUT AND HOLY LIFE (Pure Gold Classics)</h2><p>A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life by<br>William Law proclaims that God does not merely<br>forgive our disobedience, He calls us to obedience<br>and to a life completely centered in Him. Law<br>exposes pious hypocrisy and the corruption of the<br>Church. His writing is fresh and sharp, as he vividly<br>illustrates the holy Christian life as one lived totally<br>for God. &#x201c;Devotion signifies a life given, or devoted,<br>to God. He, therefore, is the devout man, who lives<br>no longer to his own will, or the way and spirit of<br>the world, but to the sole will of God ... by doing<br>everything in the name of God, and under such<br>rules as are conformable to His glory.&#x201d;</p><p>William Law (1686&#x2013;1761) was born in England in 1686. He graduated from Cambridge University and became a fellow of Emmanuel College in 1711. His Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor, in 1717, was the first distinct sign that he was an independent religious thinker. Several of Law's writings, including Practical Treatise on Christian Perfection, had an early influence on John and Charles Wesley. In 1740, Law settled in King's Cliffe, where he proceeded to carry out in everyday practice the ideas that he had set down in A Devout and Holy Life. These ideas included charity to the poor, practices of extreme generosity, kindness to animals, and attention to the smaller virtues. Many of his works caused readers to think seriously about Christianity and therefore to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. William Law died in 1761 at King's Cliffe.</p><h2>Growing Strong in the Seasons of Life</h2><p><p>What season of life are you in?

R. Martin's monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace...only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction. <br>A Feast for Crows <br>It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears....With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King's Landing. Robb Stark's demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist--or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. <br>But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces--some familiar, others only just appearing--are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. <br>It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strongwill acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them.

She uses a wide range of materials and tools, such as linoleum block, gouache, acrylic, and more.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;In her sophomore offering, Guidroz (Mina and the Monsoon), introduces Leila, a Pakistani-American girl visiting Naani (her maternal grandmother) for dinner. The book is an explosion of color and an exploration of family, togetherness, and belonging. Upon entering the house and looking in a mirror, Leila initially expresses low self-esteem. But as she moves through the evening, she describes her family and their traditions, and this reflects back her own true beauty in the end. Mirtalipova renders the entire book, especially Naani's house, in great detail, from the intricate flower patterns on the endpapers, rugs, and pillows, to the ornate metalwork on the staircase, and the delicate ornaments and books from Pakistan that Leila admires. The colors are lush pops of orange, pink, teal, and gold, which Guidroz describes in Naani's voice as the colors of lentils, pomegranates, cucumber skins, and saffron. A scarf in this last color inspires Leila to see herself as she is in the mirror, "A beautiful girl dressed in a sweet saffron scarf." Leila describes her evening using all of her senses, as she smells the ghee, and hears Naani's bangles. The cumulative experience of the book is being immersed in this warm environment. A slight stumble is the brief introduction of a gardening neighbor named "Miguel," whose appearance disrupts, rather than adds to, the narrative. Seven words, which appear throughout the book, are defined in a glossary, though their origin languages (Arabic and Hindi) are not named. VERDICT Leila's journey is a beautiful one to behold, and children will want to take it with her as they discover the power of love and family traditions.&#x2014;Clara Hendricks, Cambridge Public Library, MA</p><h2>Content Chemistry: The Illustrated Handbook for Content Marketing</h2><p>This edition has been updated to reflect new technology and marketing trends.

But when the baby gave her first cry, the<br>wind shushed to a whisper and the stars began to sing.</i><br><br><i>Brigid's Cloak</i> retells an ancient tale about one of Ireland's most beloved saints. On the day she is born Brigid receives a brilliant blue cloak from a mysterious Druid. Years later, the young girl still wears the now tattered but beloved cloak while she tends her sheep. Is it her imagination that suddenly takes her to an unfamiliar land? Or is it something far greater that leads Brigid to a crowded inn in a town called Bethlehem?<br><br>Bryce Milligan's eloquently told story about Brigid is a moving tale of compassion and wonder. Beautifully illustrated by Helen Cann, <i>Brigid's Cloak</i> sparkles with the timelessness of legend and the transcending power of faith.</p><p>Bryce Milligan is the author of five historical novels andshort story collections for young adults, including theaward winning With the Wind, Kevin Dolan (Corona).A poet, publisher, and teacher, Bryce Milligan lives in SanAntonio, Texas.<br><br>She has illustrated many books for children, includingMary's Story (Barefoot Books), HeroicChildren (Barefoot Books), and Who Laid theCornerstone of the World? (Lion). Helen lives inSurrey, England.Told with the gripping delivery of a well-seasoned storyteller, this tale of a fifth-century Irish saint has the broad appeal of folklore while retaining the power to inspire religious awe. Milligan (With the Wind; Kevin Dolan) draws in readers immediately with his evocation of "a wild and windy night" when the slave daughter of a warrior prince is born. The infant receives a visit from a Druid: "I am one of the fathers of old Ireland. I greet little Brigid, who will be a mother to the new Ireland that is to come." The Druid gives Brigid a blue cloak and blesses her with magic. Ten years later, Brigid finds herself mystically transported to a stable in Bethlehem, where a man named Joseph introduces himself and his wife, Mary: "Brigid felt as one does when a candle is lit in a very dark room." She lends Mary her cloak, and blesses Mary and her child. Returning to her own world, Brigid longs for the family in the stable-but her cloak is now covered with tiny glowing stars. Cann (The Loving Arms of God) matches Milligan's deceptively easy mix of intimacy and awe with her clear, slightly stylized watercolors. Her Brigid is plain and sturdy, with cropped red hair and freckles, her holy family tired but inwardly directed. Borders along the bottom of the spreads incorporate Celtic motifs, echoed within the illustrations with such patterns as the Druid's flowing locks of white hair, the sheep's curling wool, the striping on the rams' horns. Readers don't have to share Brigid's faith to enjoy this story, but those who do may find that faith strengthened.

Author and fly-fishing guide Lou Zambello provides all the information required for you find and successfully fish hundreds of waters in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts. Full-color maps accompany the fisheries, complete with GPS coordinates, access points, public land, access roads, boat ramps (including small hand launches), parking areas, named holes and pools and more. Many fly fishers flock to the same well-known waters that are written about again and again and face crowded conditions. Yet there are hundreds of productive waters that are ignored. Zambello, who has spent over 30 years fishing in New England, teamed with former Maine State Fisheries Director John Boland and other experts to cover many of these great uncrowded waters in the Flyfisher&#39;s Guide to New England. Lou spent the last several years criss-crossing New England researching this book, a review of many hundreds of both popular and unknown, moving and stillwaters in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. Includes recommended fly-fishing vacations, easy-access spots, and beginner suggestions.

He spent 14 years working at LL Bean in a number of capacities and has been guiding for over 13 years. Lou has been fly fishing in New England for over 30 years and has traveled to Canada, Russia, and across the US to pursue his passion. He learned flytying from his friend, Dick Talleur. Lou writes a monthly column for The Main Sportsman. Lou&#39;s wife Lindsey and their three children all fly fish.Lou Zambello s new fly fishing guide is astonishing, covering 650 rivers and streams and 500 lakes and ponds throughout New England. As Lou notes in the introduction: What is included are the best and most popular (not always the same thing) fisheries... (and) lesser known waters that we have fished. The best part of the book, Flyfisher s Guide to New England, for me is that it brought back many wonderful fishing memories. Yes, I have fished in quite a few of the Maine waters featured in this book. And while Lou gave away many of my favorite waters, I am grateful he didn t include some of my very favorite places, all of which I would put in a category of lesser known waters. As he wrote, Part of angling fun is to find and explore your own secret spots, so maybe it is a good idea not to catalog and systematically write about every possibility and to leave some uncertainty out there. Yes Lou, you are right, and thank you for not giving away some of my secret spots! The book tells you everything you need to know to enjoy a lifetime of fishing all over New England, from maps and directions to the flies to use and the times of the year to fish there. There are suggestions for beginners, families, and old guys like me who need easy-accessible places to fish. It is very thorough. And obviously, you ll never be able to fish them all, but I ll bet you ll quickly build a list of new places you must get to. I did. I first got to know Lou when he worked at LL Bean. For the last 14 years he s been a Maine guide in the Rangeley region, and he writes one of my favorite columns in The Maine Sportsman. He also writes a popular fishing blog, posted on his website. ... With the heavy 350 page book on my lap, I turned first to the Rangeley waters, where I have spent a lot of time fishing. And I have to report, Lou got it all right. He even included my new favorite spot, the Upper Magalloway, where my friend Bruce Verrill owns a camp on Rump Pond. Lou writes about all of my favorite waters, including the Rapid River, Kennebago River, Upper Dam, and even the short but very fun Rangeley River. The book includes awesome photos, and you ll spend some time enjoying those. I was disappointed to learn that, In 2014 after a series of heavy rain events in early August, schools of salmonids ascended the (Kennebago) river, and in mid-August the fishing was unbelievable, although few anglers were around to enjoy it. Man, I missed that! I always try to get up to the Kennebago in September, typically when spawning salmon and trout come up the river. You can bet I ll be watching for heavy rainfalls in August now. I appreciated Lou s report on the Rapid, when he noted, The fishery is not what it once was because of the invasion of smallmouth bass and (perhaps) stocked fish, but it still gives up some very large trout every year. There are also plentiful landlocked salmon from 14 to 17 inches as well. ... Now, if I had room for 50,000 words in this book review, I d tell you my stories of fishing these wonderful waters. Lou also covers my favorite waters in the Baxter Park area, where I have a camp on Nesowadnehunk Lake. Interestingly, when he wrote about all the access points to the famous West Branch of the Penobscot River, one of my all-time favorite waters, he didn t mention the trail I hike to one of my favorite spots. And I m not telling you either! --George Smith, Bangor Daily News<br><br>In this handy resource, author and fly fishing guide Lou Zambello provides information to improve your catch rate in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts.

The only reason that life can exist on Earth at all, everything from figs to walruses to TV repairmen, is because of the light and warmth we get from our nearest star.<br> <br>This is the Sun.<br> <br><br> <br>Wait, that&#x2019;s not right. Why would the Sun need to wear sunglasses? Think about it; how would that help? Let&#x2019;s try that again.<br> <br><br><br>No Crayons Allowed<br> <br>Please don&#x2019;t color this drawing with a yellow crayon, Junior Geniuses. Not only would that deface this fine book, it would also be scientifically inaccurate! Sunlight only looks yellow to us because we&#x2019;re seeing it through our atmosphere. From space the Sun is perfectly white!<br> <br><br><br>When you look at the Sun&#x2014;wait, hold on. Public service announcement:<br> <br><br> <br>The light is so intense it can literally cook the retinas in your eyes. To observe the Sun, glance and then look away. Don&#x2019;t stare. There are health faddists called &#x201c;sungazers&#x201d; who claim they get all their nutrition from staring at the Sun a few minutes a day. But that really doesn&#x2019;t work, so please don&#x2019;t try this.<br> <br><br> <br>Okay. When you briefly glance at the Sun, you&#x2019;re actually looking back in time! Sunlight travels at the speed of light, which means it takes an average of eight minutes and twenty seconds for it to reach the Earth. So the Sun outside your window isn&#x2019;t actually where you think it is. By the time you see it, the real Sun has moved forward two Sun-diameters in the sky.<br> <br><br> <br>But we&#x2019;re going to travel back in time even further: not eight and a half minutes but 4.5 billion years! That&#x2019;s when the story of our solar system begins.<br> A Star Is Born<p></p> <br><br> <br>Over 4 billion years ago a nebula&#x2014;a gigantic space-cloud of gas&#x2014;collapsed on itself, possibly due to the shock wave from a nearby exploding star. As it shrank, the whirling cloud began to spin faster and faster and grow hotter and hotter. It flattened into a big pizza-shaped thing called a protoplanetary disk, and soon thereafter (just 50 million years&#x2014;that&#x2019;s &#x201c;soon&#x201d; in cosmic terms!) the middle of the disk got hot enough to light its nuclear furnace. The Sun was born!<br> <br><br> <br>A lot of the leftover dust and gas spinning around the new baby Sun began to clump together, which is how planets form. But these weren&#x2019;t the planets we know today! There were probably hundreds of little planets zooming around and smashing into each other, until they merged into bigger ones. Others collided at such high speeds (due to the immense gravity of big planets like Jupiter and Saturn) that they shattered into tiny chunks called asteroids.<br> <br>Today, just eight main planets survive, most of which we&#x2019;ve named for different gods of Roman mythology.<br> <br><br><br>Pop Quiz!<br> <br>Since classical times, we&#x2019;ve used special symbols to refer to the planets and most refer to mythology. The Venus symbol, , looks like a mirror, because she was the goddess of beauty. Mars looks like a spear and shield, , because he was the god of war. What is the Neptune symbol, , supposed to be?<br> <br><br> <br> Spaceballs<p></p> <br>But that diagram isn&#x2019;t quite accurate, because the solar system is much, much bigger than we can draw in a book. The Sun is massively bigger than everything else, for one thing. It accounts for 99.8 percent of the mass of the solar system! (Jupiter is most of the rest.)<br> <br><br> <br>The distances between planets are even harder to imagine. Let&#x2019;s pretend that a superpowerful alien has somehow shrunk the eight planets of our solar system to fit inside a baseball stadium. (This alien is apparently a big baseball fan.) The solar system is so big that our massive Sun would be the size of a golf ball, sitting at home plate! At this scale, Mercury is a dust speck in the batter&#x2019;s box, while Venus and Earth are grains of sand near the edge of the home plate circle. Mars is another dust speck one-third of the way to the pitcher&#x2019;s mound. Jupiter and Saturn are the sizes of apple seeds, with Jupiter sitting just past the pitcher&#x2019;s mound and Saturn at second base. Uranus is a pinhead near one of the foul poles, and Neptune is a pinhead at the fence in deep center field. (Pluto got kicked out of the ballpark in 2006 for arguing with the umpires. Hit the showers, Pluto.)<br> <br><br> <br>Here&#x2019;s the bottom line, Junior Geniuses: Space is incredibly big. Our little solar system by itself&#x2014;our own tiny neighborhood in a vast galaxy&#x2014;is so big that it fries even my amazing brain when I try to think about it.<br><br>Junior Genius Joviality!<br> <br>Ask a grown-up how far it&#x2019;s possible to see on a clear day. I guarantee they will guess low! The correct answer, as long as you can see the Sun, is &#x201c;93 million miles.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s also known as one &#x201c;astronomical unit&#x201d;&#x2014;the distance from the Earth to the Sun.<br> <br> Whirled News<p></p> <br>Today we take it for granted that the planets of the solar system spin around the Sun, but for most of history people have assumed that the Earth was the center of the universe! Five hundred years ago heliocentrism (&#x201c;hee-lee-oh-SENT-rizz-um&#x201d;), or the idea that the Sun was the center of things, was so controversial that people who believed it could be put on trial. The great astronomer Galileo spent the last ten years of his life under house arrest for insisting it was the Earth that moved around the Sun, not the other way around.<br> <br><br> <br>But&#x2014;sorry, Galileo!&#x2014;that doesn&#x2019;t mean the Sun is the exact center of the solar system! Gravity works both ways, Junior Geniuses. The Sun tugs on each planet&#x2014;take Jupiter for instance&#x2014;in a big way, because the sun is so massive. But, at the same time, Jupiter is tugging on the Sun in a small way. Instead of saying that Jupiter orbits the Sun, it&#x2019;s more accurate to say that they both orbit a third point, called a barycenter, which is about thirty thousand miles above the surface of the Sun.<br> <br><br><br>Are You Sitting Still?<br> <br><br> <br>The Earth is moving at a pretty good clip right now: spinning on its axis at 1,000 miles per hour and whirling around the Sun at 66,000 miles per hour. But don&#x2019;t forget that the Sun is moving too, spinning around the Milky Way like a giant pinwheel at about 483,000 miles per hour. And today scientists can use leftover radiation from the Big Bang to measure how fast our whole galaxy is moving through the universe: 1.3 million miles per hour!<br> <br>We don&#x2019;t feel any of this motion, of course, because everything around us is moving at the exact same speed we are. But the next time a grown-up says, &#x201c;Have you been sitting in that chair all day? Get up and get some exercise!&#x201d; tell them you&#x2019;ve already covered a few million miles today, and you&#x2019;re pooped!<br> <br> All Systems Glow<p></p> <br>But let&#x2019;s take a close-up look at the Sun. (NOTE: AGAIN, DO NOT TAKE A REAL CLOSE-UP LOOK AT THE SUN. IT IS VERY BRIGHT.) Luckily, Mr. Sun produces a lot of energy, or we would be very cold right now and bumping into things all the time. But where does that energy come from?<br> <br><br> <br>At the middle of the Sun is a very dense core, where the pressure gets pretty intense&#x2014;over one hundred times what it is at the bottom of Earth&#x2019;s oceans, in fact. All that gravity pushes atoms together with a pressure of one hundred tons per square inch, enough to crush atoms into each other. Hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium atoms, and that process produces the energy that powers the Sun.<br><br>Lighter than Air<br> <br>Helium is the second most common element in the universe (after hydrogen), but it went undiscovered until 1868, when astronomers spotted the wavelength of a new element in the sunlight emitting from an eclipse. Earth has large underground deposits of helium gas, but the element was discovered millions of miles away on the Sun almost thirty years before it was discovered right here under our feet!<br><br><br> <br>The fusion in the Sun&#x2019;s core produces little energy particles called photons&#x2014;but they don&#x2019;t radiate out into space right away. In fact, they bounce around inside the Sun for thousands of years before making their way to the surface.<br> <br>So the sunlight you see in the sky today might have been born in the Sun&#x2019;s core as much as 170,000 years ago!<br> <br><br> <br>All that fusion produces a lot of energy. In fact, the Sun produces the equivalent of 77 trillion atomic bombs&#x2014;every second. If we could somehow collect just one second&#x2019;s worth of that energy, it could power human civilization for the next half a million years!<br> <br><br> <br>Despite all that, the weird thing about the surface of the Sun is that it&#x2019;s not very hot. Well, okay, it&#x2019;s almost ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit, which is pretty hot for, say, a bowl of ramen. But it&#x2019;s not that hot on a cosmic scale. Right here on Earth, a bolt of lightning is five times hotter than the surface of the Sun, which doesn&#x2019;t seem right. The temperature at the core of the sun is 27 million degrees Fahrenheit, while its outermost layer, the corona, is 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit. So why is the bright photosphere so much chillier than the dark corona?<br> <br><br> <br>For many years scientists were baffled, but a new discovery may partly explain the problem. We now know that, believe it or not, there are thousands of giant magnetic tornadoes swirling around the upper levels of the Sun at speeds greater than six thousand miles an hour. Some are the size of the United States! These twisters pull heat from the inner layers of the Sun and inject it out into the corona.<br> Fun on the Sun<p></p> <br>Giant megatornadoes aren&#x2019;t the only thing the surface of the Sun has going for it. In fact, there&#x2019;s a lot to see on the Sun. (NOTE: AGAIN, DO NOT TRY TO SEE THINGS ON THE SUN. IT IS DANGEROUSLY BIG AND SHINY.)<br> <br>DO NOT LOOK AT THE SUN!<br><br><br> SOLAR PROMINENCES<p></p> <br>What are they? Huge loops of gas that surge out into space and can hang around for weeks or even months.<br> <br>Cool, but why should I care? Because they&#x2019;re huge! The biggest ones on record extended half a million miles into space.<br><br><br> SUNSPOTS<p></p> <br>What are they? Dark, cool dots on the Sun&#x2019;s surface caused by magnetism. They come and go in an eleven-year cycle.<br> <br>Cool, but why should I care? They may have helped cause an ice age! In the late seventeenth century, a period of low sunspot activity called the Maunder Minimum corresponded with a period of bitterly cold weather.<br><br><br> SOLAR WIND<p></p> <br>What is it? A constant stream of invisible but electrically charged particles the Sun releases in all directions.<br> <br>Cool, but why should I care? It could interrupt your cartoons. Strong solar wind can mess up radio and TV signals. It also causes the auroras that shine in the sky over the North and South Poles.<br><br><br> SOLAR FLARES<p></p> <br>What are they? Sudden bright flashes on the Sun that eject a massive amount of energy from the corona.<br> <br>Cool, but why should I care? They could literally light you on fire! The Carrington Event was a massive solar storm caused by a flare on September 1, 1859. The northern lights extended all the way south to the Caribbean that day, and were so bright you could read by them all night. Birds started chirping at midnight, and people accidentally got up and went to work. Telegraph poles all over the world sparked, and some telegraph machines built up so much charge they could send messages without being plugged in! In Washington, DC, an arc of fire jumped from the telegraph to the head of its operator, badly burning him.<br><br><br> It Came from the Oort Cloud!<p></p> <br>The solar wind is also what puts the tails on comets! Comets are chunks of ice and dust a few miles wide that come from two areas with funny names way out at the edge of the solar system: the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud. Their very long orbits occasionally bring them near the Earth, and we can see their 60-million-mile-long tails of gas and dust being &#x201c;blown&#x201d; away from the coma (the &#x201c;head&#x201d; of the comet) by the solar wind.<br><br> <br>THE TAIL DOESN&#x2019;T TRAVEL &#x201c;BEHIND&#x201d; THE COMET AS IT MOVES . . .

Sure enough, he died in 1910, one day after the comet&#x2019;s return.<br><br>Panic in the Streets<br> <br>When Halley&#x2019;s Comet passed by Earth in 1910, one astronomer predicted that the gases in the comet&#x2019;s tail might be poisonous.

It will finally be safe to look at the Sun without a grown-up nagging you!<br> <br>But before it gets colder, the Sun will do something worse: It will get hotter!

Would you rather sell shoes for a living? Or be an accountant? Both are honorable occupations, but wouldn&#x2019;t you like to wake up eager to go to work, use every part of yourself while at work, and maybe, just maybe, have a tiny impact on the world? That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m doing it.<br><br> We all like movies. Heck, that&#x2019;s why you bought this book. We&#x2019;re all critics, too; we know what is a good movie, and we know what isn&#x2019;t. A lot of times we even think we know why. I know I do. Indeed, I felt that way long before I got into the movie business. So, how about a job where you&#x2019;re the one who decides what movie to make, and how it should be made? A producer. That sounded exciting to me a long time ago, and it still does. What&#x2019;s more, producing is that rare profession where you can start at the top&#x2014;if you control a super, terrific, dynamite script.<br><br> There are many levels and categories of producing: line producers, executive producers, co-producers, associate producers, assistant producers. Line producers are physical production specialists. Executive producers get their credits for anything from arranging the money, to controlling the property, to being manager of the star or director, to being the studio executive overseeing the film. The associate producer title is a catchall, bestowed upon anyone the producer deems worthy. But the real deal is the producer. He or she runs the show. It&#x2019;s the producer, and only the producer, who accepts the Academy Award for best picture.<br><br> I actually feel the same today as I did in 1967, when I was interviewed by a young kid writing for the now-defunct <i>Cinema</i> magazine. That young kid was Curtis Hanson, who has since entered the top echelon of writer-directors with an Academy Award best-screenplay win, plus best-director and best-picture nominations, for <i>L.A. Confidential </i>(after having directed <i>The River Wild</i> for me). When Hanson questioned why I chose to go into filmmaking, I replied: &#x201c;Nothing could be more rewarding or stimulating. I think everyone in the business feels the same way. If every salary were cut in half, not one person would leave. I chose producing because it would coalesce both my background experience and modicum of ability in business with what I immodestly and laughingly thought of as my good taste and judgment. Boy, what fun to decide whether a picture should be made, to decide or influence a decision that something should be done this way instead of that way, and to see if I can get this artistic quality here within the framework of that kind of budget money there. Each day has new challenges, new battles, new struggles, new frustrations, new satisfactions. Each day as I wake up I figure I&#x2019;ll walk into the office and get hit with a right to the heart and a left to the kidney, but I love it. It&#x2019;s uphill all the way because it&#x2019;s so competitive and ephemeral and frustrating. There are many frustrations within the framework, but the satisfactions are just enormous. Even the complainers love it.&#x201d;<br><br> There&#x2019;s hardly a better job around. A producer is the person who decides an idea, a character, or a story is worth telling. I initiate every single film project upon which I work; most of them would not have seen the light of day had I not decided to make them.<br><br><i>I really believe that there are things nobody would see unless I photographed them</i>. &#x2014;Diane Arbus<br><br> That&#x2019;s exactly how I feel about most of the films I&#x2019;ve produced. I&#x2019;m the &#x201c;starter&#x201d; and also the &#x201c;finisher,&#x201d; and am therefore involved in every aspect and most details of production. It may begin with an original idea of mine (<i>Caveman</i>), a book (<i>The Graduate, The Flim-Flam Man</i>), a play (<i>Mass Appeal, The Best Man</i>), reading a play prior to its production (<i>The Great White Hope, Tribute</i>), an original screenplay (<i>Full Moon on Blue Water, Second Thoughts</i>), or an idea a writer brings to me (<i>Running Scared</i>). In all cases, I arrange for the financing, without which a project can&#x2019;t get off the ground. I work closely with the writer structuring and detailing the story. I select the director and, with him or her, select the actors and consult about the look and style of the picture, as well as the actual production of the film, including hiring the crew, editing, selecting the composer, and discussing what kind of music is to be used and where it should be placed in the film. I am also involved in the ad campaign and the overall marketing and distribution strategies. As producer, I am the editor and sounding board for all the other creative talents, hopefully enhancing their work and coalescing all into a unified whole.<br><br> As a producer, you use every part of yourself. It&#x2019;s always challenging; you&#x2019;re never bored. It&#x2019;s creative, it&#x2019;s working with interesting, diverse people, exercising your taste, your judgment. You also get to meet and know unusual, accomplished people&#x2014;in my case, everyone from Wernher von Braun, father of the space program, to Noel Coward, to Henry Kissinger. The job involves travel to unusual places, for me from the Kentucky Derby to the car races in Le Mans. Each movie project becomes a journey of discovery. Each has different types of characters; each is in a different setting or environment; each deals with things you haven&#x2019;t seen or heard before&#x2014;you&#x2019;re learning and growing all the time. And each movie involves a new, different set of collaborators&#x2014;all worldly, creative, and stimulating&#x2014;and many will become lifelong friends.<br><br><i>I love making movies . . . so much. I mean, there&#x2019;s plenty of pain and heartache, and every day is a roller coaster. . . . I will never retire. I am a person who wants to discover and learn, and that sort of drives me. . . . The experience of every movie is a different experience of the variables in that equation, and that&#x2019;s not only exciting and dynamic, but it&#x2019;s challenging in that trial and error, hopefully, if you&#x2019;re aware, moves you to a better, more evolved place the next day</i>. &#x2014;Brian Grazer (Academy Award&#x2013;winning producer of <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>)<br><br> What could be more gratifying? Very little, I think. And I&#x2019;ve just been talking about the icing on the cake. The cake for me is my personal expression. The idea or theme behind each film I choose to do is my conscious or, sometimes, unconscious signature, through which I express my values to my peers and to the world. I like to think&#x2014;I do think&#x2014;that I can affect the world, or at least a few people in it. My concerns, my themes, seem to be consistent. <i>American History X</i>, a film I executive produced, made audiences confront how destructive hate can be. It&#x2019;s the story of an American racist neo-Nazi skinhead who ultimately rejects that way of life, but whose own brother is murdered as a consequence of his actions. <i>The Great White Hope</i>, which I produced thirty years earlier, was also about racism. It was the story of the first African American heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Johnson, who, by merely holding the title of world&#x2019;s best, inflamed not only the white boxing establishment but many people throughout America. When Muhammed Ali visited the set, he told me, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my story!&#x201d;<br><br><i>The idea of getting to sit in a room with a cup of coffee and talk about a story for a few hours is really one of the privileges and pleasures. There&#x2019;s nothing more fun than talking about some movie like </i>Memoirs of a Geisha,<i> and you sit around with some really smart writer, and you&#x2019;re talking about how some woman might behave in 1920s Kyoto. And then, literally a half-hour later, you&#x2019;re talking about Custer and how he changed American history. I just love a day that takes you from ancient Rome to the Old West</i>. &#x2014;Doug Wick (Academy Award winner for <i>Gladiator</i>)<br><br> Even the seemingly &#x201c;guns and giggles&#x201d; <i>Running Scared </i>(Billy Crystal&#x2019;s first screen role), which I co-produced, had a serious underlying theme: two cops (Gregory Hines is the other) who are near retirement decide to play it &#x201c;safe&#x201d; and avoid getting hurt by not tempting danger. Except all hell breaks loose and they succeed by reverting to their true natures, by not &#x201c;running scared.&#x201d; The moral? You&#x2019;ve got to try your hardest all the time, whether you&#x2019;re a cop, athlete, or producer.<br><br> <i>The Best Man</i>, based on Gore Vidal&#x2019;s play and which I co-produced, is a political movie about compromises, backroom deals, distortions of the truth, the power of the press, and the glare of public life, all of which are as pertinent today&#x2014;if not more so&#x2014;than decades ago when we made the film. Those themes are pieces of myself. I&#x2019;d like the titles of those films, plus others I&#x2019;ve produced, engraved on my tombstone. (Well, there are a couple I&#x2019;d like excised.)<br><br> Is there anything more exhilarating than completing a film that began life as an idea in your head and then sitting in a crowded movie theater, hearing the audience laugh, or hold its collective breath, seeing tears flow, and perhaps hearing some applause? For me, no&#x2014;unless it&#x2019;s seeing my sons grow and flourish. But they also began life as an idea in my head.<br><br> Is it a roller-coaster ride? For sure. One reason to be a producer is that it&#x2019;s a damn exciting life. I guarantee you&#x2019;ll never be bored. But you&#x2019;ll also never be relaxed. As the great baseball player Satchel Paige said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look back. Someone might be gaining on you.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not that it&#x2019;s a competition with your fellow producers. There are just so few movie slots at each studio, and so many&#x2014;too damn many&#x2014;producers chasing them. That&#x2019;s why you have to be creative. And isn&#x2019;t using your creativity in trying to make movies, and then actually making them, the biggest reward? I think so. You&#x2019;re constantly using your imagination, your ingenuity, and your brain power. Each day at work you&#x2019;ll be living to the fullest. So why not play the game, where you decide what movie to try to make, and sometimes get it made? What beats that? Maybe scoring the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl . . . but even that takes less creativity than producing movies.<br><br><i>Each movie presents a genuine new challenge. On every movie I feel like you learn something you need to know, that I didn&#x2019;t know. It never gets dull</i>. &#x2014;Christine Vachon (<i>Far from Heaven, One Hour Photo, Boys Don&#x2019;t Cry, Happiness</i>)<br><br> If your imagination is fired about becoming a producer, I say go for it. Or go for whatever your dream is because if you don&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;ll live to regret it. &#x201c;I shoulda; I coulda,&#x201d; are words you do not want to even think, much less utter, five or ten years down the road. My favorite line in all of musical literature was written by Oscar Hammerstein, in <i>Carousel</i>: &#x201c;I let my golden chances pass me by.&#x201d; Or, as the poem by Whittier says, &#x201c;Of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, it might have been.&#x201d; However, if someone&#x2014;family or a friend, perhaps&#x2014;can talk you out of it, beware . . . you probably won&#x2019;t make it. It is tough and it is competitive. If you&#x2019;re not prepared to give 100 percent, just about all the time&#x2014;and I mean more than an eight- or nine-hour workday&#x2014;forget about it. But if you are, if you do, I guarantee it&#x2019;s worth it.<br><br><i>Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too.

Angler&#x2019;s sharp wit and dexterity with political themes are matched only by the thrilling suspense on every page.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lis Wiehl, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and FOX News correspondent</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Everyone gets the Mark.&nbsp;It gives all the benefits of citizenship.&nbsp;Yet if getting the Mark is such a good thing, then why does it feel so wrong?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Set in a future North America that is struggling to recover after famine and global war, <em>Swipe</em> follows the lives of three kids caught in the middle of a conflict they didn&#x2019;t even know existed. United under a charismatic leader, every citizen of the American Union is required to get the Mark on their&nbsp;13th birthday in order to gain the benefits of citizenship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Mark is a tattoo that must be swiped by special scanners for everything from employment to transportation to shopping. It&#x2019;s almost Logan Langly&#x2019;s 13th birthday and he knows he should be excited about getting the Mark, but he hasn&#x2019;t been able to shake the feeling he&#x2019;s being watched. Not since his sister went to get her Mark five years ago . . . and never came back.&nbsp;</p><p>When Logan and his friends discover the truth behind the Mark, will they ever be able to go back to being normal teenagers? Find out in the first book of this exciting series that is <em>Left Behind</em> meets <em>Matched</em> for middle-grade readers.</p></p><p>Evan Angler is safe, for now. He lives without the Mark, evading DOME and writing in the shadows of Beacon. But if anyone asks, you know nothing about him. Don&#39;t make eye contact if you see him. Don&#39;t call his name out loud. He&#39;s in enough trouble already. And so are you, if you read his books.Gr 7-10-Evan Angler's futuristic novel (Thomas Nelson, 2012) is set in North America where everyone is struggling to recover from famine and global war. Logan Langly is about to turn 13, and he is not really looking forward to receiving the Mark, even though it is basically a rite of passage that most kids are anticipating. His reluctance stems from the fact that his sister previously left to get her Mark and never returned. The Mark, a tattoo that can be swiped, is a sign of independence. Those with the tattoo become citizens of the Union, and they are permitted to get jobs, use public transportation, receive medical care, and shop for themselves. Logan feels like he is being watched and followed. He becomes friends with Erin, the new girl in town, and they work together to find out the truth behind the Mark. Narrator Barrie Buckner does a great job of evoking the emotions of the three main characters and his reading helps to build suspense. Sure to be a hit with fans of dystopian fiction.

Copies of Sears&#39;s books ENTER THE ZONE and MASTERING THE ZONE have sold more than 2 million copies. Finally, this plan is being adapted to the British palate and cupboard. All 150 recipes in this book will be anglicized and will make The ZONE more accessible than ever before. Dr. Sears is writing a new introduction for the UK marketplace. In short, THE ZONE goes against recently received wisdom about the health benefits of low-fat high-carbohydrate diets and suggests that if we continue to eat a lot of grains we will simply get fatter. Sears contends that too much carbohydrate (which converts to sugar) upsets our delicate hormonal balance and throws us into a constant sugar-craving state and gives rise to a diabetic-like condition. By balancing our diet and eating more protein and fat we enter a Zone of optimum metabolic function and peak performance. Eating in THE ZONE will not only burn fat but it will also fight heart disease, diabetes, PMS, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression and more.</p><p>Dr. Barry Sears is a pioneer in biotechnology, developing drug delivery systems for cancer and heart patients.

In 2001, it finally found its way into the hands of a team of experts who would painstakingly reassemble and restore it. <i>The Gospel of Judas</i> has been translated from its original Coptic to clear prose, and is accompanied by commentary that explains its fascinating history in the context of the early Church, offering a whole new way of understanding the message of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Rodolphe Kasser, Ph.D., a professor emeritus on the Faculty of Arts at the University of Geneva, is one of the world&#x2019;s leading Coptologists.

Titles such as Dinosaur Roar! (written by Henrietta Stickland), Ten Terrible Dinosaurs, Swamp Stomp, A Number of Dinosaurs, Truck Jam, Big Dig, The Christmas Bear, One Bear One Dog and many more. Paul has spent 20 years working with children of all ages and abilities in schools, libraries and festivals all over the UK and abroad, giving inspiring talks, drawing and pop up book workshops, engaging and empowering children with his energy and enthusiasm. He lives in a world of colourful characters and creatures, from diggers to dinosaurs, bears to bugs and he loves to share this with children through the medium of children&#39;s books and pop up paper. Inspired by his artist and illustrator grandfather, Geoffrey Squire, and his very creative parents, Paul has always loved working with children. He lives in Sherborne, Dorset, with his bookseller and musician wife, Helen, their daughter Tabitha and a selection of Paul&#39;s five creative and musical sons.They're going to discover Barney soon enough, if they haven't already, so parents may want to head them off at the pass with this cast of dinosaurs who are as diverse and rife with character as Barney is, well, purple. These dinosaurs, as colorfully and cleverly conceived by the Sticklands (The Christmas Bear, 1993), are huge but meek, tiny but fierce, clean but awfully prim, slovenly but affectionate. A ``sweet'' dinosaur tries to coyly ``hide'' behind a tree thinner than its arm; a ``fat'' dinosaur lounges with a palm tree between its fingers, about to chew it as if it were a blade of grass; in a primordial dinner scene, herbivores and carnivores alike look on in bemused astonishment as one strange creature, passing up both the foliage and the bones that are politely being consumed all around, feasts on the ``h'' in ``scrunch!'' Crafty details like these transform what might otherwise be just another look at the oldest cast of characters in children's literature into a visual extravaganza.

The three girls are there to visit Bess&#x2019;s family friend Jenna and go to the opening of an exhibit at the local whaling museum. Jenna&#x2019;s been working on the exhibit for months, but when the girls get to the museum, a threatening banner has replaced the welcome sign.<br> <br>Nancy&#x2019;s got plenty of potential suspects, but she&#x2019;s worried she won&#x2019;t be able to solve the case in time to save the opening. And as the threats increase in severity, she becomes more concerned about Jenna&#x2019;s safety than the ruined exhibit. Can Nancy find the culprit in time?</p><p>Carolyn Keene is the author of the ever-popular Nancy Drew books.The Phantom of Nantucket <br> <br>CHAPTER ONE<br> <br><br> <br>Ahoy!<br> <br>&#x201c;LAND HO!&#x201d; MY FRIEND GEORGE CALLED, waking me from my nap.<br> <br>It took me a second to recall where I was, but I grinned as soon as I remembered. I was on a ferryboat headed toward Nantucket Island for a Labor Day weekend of beaches, ice cream, and museums. It had been a busy summer of work and family obligations, and I was looking forward to some time off before the fall.<br> <br>I sat up straight and looked at where George was pointing. Through the fog, I could just make out the edge of the shoreline and a lighthouse standing tall above the rocks. Painted in bright red-and-white stripes with a glass top that allowed the light to shine through, warning arriving boats of the rocks, it looked exactly how I had hoped it would.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just like a postcard!&#x201d; I exclaimed.<br> <br>A voice boomed over the PA system, &#x201c;We will be docking at the Nantucket Ferry Terminal in approximately twenty minutes. Please take the time now to gather your belongings and clean the area around your seats. Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I put away the book I had been reading before I drifted off.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better wake Bess. You know she&#x2019;ll want to put herself together,&#x201d; George said, rolling her eyes.<br> <br>My best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne are cousins, but you&#x2019;d never guess it. They&#x2019;re about as opposite as you can get. Bess isn&#x2019;t a girly-girl, but she likes to wear nice clothes and her hair is always perfectly styled. For this trip, she was wearing seersucker pants, a pink collared shirt, and a yellow V-neck sweater. She fit in seamlessly with the other tourists on the ferry. George, on the other hand, keeps her hair short so she doesn&#x2019;t have to think about it and wears jeans and sneakers every day. I&#x2019;m more in the middle. I&#x2019;m not the fashionista that Bess is, but I like to look nice. I guess that&#x2019;s why the three of us are best friends. We all fit together, and we each have our own place.<br> <br>I shook Bess&#x2019;s shoulder gently, and she woke with a start. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; she asked through a yawn.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; I told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, good,&#x201d; Bess said, reaching into her purse and pulling out a hairbrush. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of . . . moving.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew what she meant. It had been a long trip. We&#x2019;d left our hometown of River Heights at seven a.m., and now it was almost five p.m. When Bess&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s oldest friend had invited us all here for the opening of her daughter Jenna&#x2019;s exhibit at the local nautical museum, I hadn&#x2019;t realized just what a journey it would be to get to Nantucket.<br> <br>&#x201c;I counted,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been on four �different types of transportation today: car to the airport, plane, bus to the dock, and now ferry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe Jenna will have bikes we can ride to get that number up to five,&#x201d; I joked.<br> <br>Bess wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Jenna&#x2019;s the type to ride bikes.&#x201d; She offered George her hairbrush.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; George asked, declining the brush. I took it instead.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s just someone who really focuses on whatever she has to do. She got straight As in college. Jenna is just an unpaid intern at the museum, but apparently she hasn&#x2019;t been to the beach once all summer. She&#x2019;s spent all her free time in the library! While she was there she made some important discovery, so they gave her a show to curate all by herself. The whole reason her parents can&#x2019;t come to the opening is because they never imagined she would have her own show so soon. They bought tickets to Italy months ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>We could hear the engines of the ferry slowing. People around us started to get up.<br> <br>&#x201c;She sounds intense,&#x201d; I noted.<br> <br>Bess nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good word for her, but she&#x2019;s also really nice. We&#x2019;re going to have fun this weekend, I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, we are docking. We will be disembarking from the starboard side of the ship,&#x201d; boomed a voice from the loudspeaker.<br> <br>George, Bess, and I exchanged looks. We weren&#x2019;t quite sure which direction starboard was, but everyone around us was headed toward the right side of the ferry, so we followed them. George lagged behind us, lugging her gigantic backpack. She practically staggered as she adjusted to its weight.<br> <br>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t understand why you felt the need to bring so many electronics with you,&#x201d; Bess commented.<br> <br>&#x201c;What else are you supposed to do on vacation?&#x201d; George asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Bess pondered, &#x201c;lie on the beach, go for a hike, shop&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>George cut her off right there. &#x201c;That might be what you do on vacation, but when I&#x2019;m on vacation, I play computer games, read on my tablet, see what&#x2019;s happening on the Internet. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess shook her head as she held open the door to the outer deck of the boat. From here we could see people gathering on the dock, waving to the ferry. Walking to the side, Bess peered into the crowd, looking for Jenna.<br> <br>&#x201c;There she is!&#x201d; Bess shouted, waving.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which one is she?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Detective Drew, you can figure it out,&#x201d; Bess joked. My friends like to tease me because in our hometown of River Heights I&#x2019;m something of an amateur sleuth. A while ago I discovered that I was pretty good at solving mysteries, and now people ask me to help them if they think someone is stealing from their business or cheating in a competition . . . things like that. I scanned the crowd, searching the sea of pastel polo shirts until I saw a serious-looking young woman in a Nantucket �Nautical Museum sweatshirt standing with perfect posture, her long brown hair tied back into a tight ponytail.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see her!&#x201d; I exclaimed, pointing.<br> <br>&#x201c;You solved the case!&#x201d; Bess laughed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish they were all that easy,&#x201d; I joked back, as we walked down the ramp off the boat. I glanced at George. It was unusual for her to be quiet for this long. She was staring down at Jenna, looking slightly nervous. George is always so confident and tough; it hadn&#x2019;t occurred to me that she might be anxious about fitting in with Jenna. Bess and Jenna had known each other their entire lives&#x2014;their moms had been friends since childhood&#x2014;but Jenna&#x2019;s family lived several states away from us. Still, Bess&#x2019;s and Jenna&#x2019;s families saw each other every year; they even had a tradition of going skiing together. George and I had heard stories about Jenna for years, but neither of us had ever met her. Originally, Bess&#x2019;s mom had said that my boyfriend, Ned, could come with us to Nantucket, but George had asked me whether it was okay if it was just the three of us. She didn&#x2019;t want to feel like a third wheel with Ned and me and Bess and Jenna. I would have said yes no matter what, but it worked out perfectly, since Ned&#x2019;s family always took their annual camping trip over Labor Day weekend.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Bess.&#x201d; Jenna greeted Bess with a stiff hug. <br> <br>Bess introduced us to Jenna. &#x201c;This is my cousin George Fayne and our friend Nancy Drew.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna took both of our hands in a firm, businesslike shake. &#x201c;Thank you for coming. It&#x2019;s great to know that the reception won&#x2019;t just be myself and Pete, the museum&#x2019;s director!&#x201d;<br> <br>I noticed the baggage cart making its way down the ramp with our luggage. We followed Jenna as she led us to where it would stop.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the reception will be great,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Bess&#x2019;s mom told us you made a really big discovery about a shipwreck?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna pushed us through the crowd, making sure we would be the first people to get our bags. &#x201c;It is significant, but you never know how the public will react to something like this, and it&#x2019;s extra important that it go really well. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna trailed off, and I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what she was going to say. That&#x2019;s one problem with being a detective: You can&#x2019;t stand unanswered questions.<br> <br>&#x201c;What makes the reception so critical?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Whitestone, the president of the museum&#x2019;s board of trustees, is coming. If he&#x2019;s impressed by the turnout and the exhibit, Pete says there&#x2019;s a really good chance he&#x2019;ll offer me a permanent position.&#x201d; Despite herself, Jenna broke out into a big smile.<br> <br>Bess hugged her. &#x201c;Jenna, that&#x2019;s amazing! This has been your dream job since you were a little girl. Congratulations!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna put her finger to her lips. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t jinx it! It&#x2019;s not a done deal yet. I still need everything to go perfectly tomorrow night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but it will. I mean, I know you; you&#x2019;ve probably checked everything a hundred times already,&#x201d; Bess said.<br> <br>The baggage carts pulled up and George, Bess, and I retrieved our suitcases. Jenna checked her watch. &#x201c;The museum is actually just up the street. Do you mind if we stop by before going back to my house? They&#x2019;re hanging a brand-new exhibit banner at five thirty. We could just make it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mind?&#x201d; Bess said. &#x201c;We wouldn&#x2019;t miss it!&#x201d;<br> <br>We followed Jenna out of the parking lot around the ferry dock, past a row of seafood restaurants, ice-cream parlors, and T-shirt shops. The streets were made of cobblestone and the sidewalks, paved in red brick.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this why people call Nantucket the Little Gray Lady?&#x201d; I asked Jenna as we passed a row of gray-�shingled buildings.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s actually because of all the fog, but your reasoning also works,&#x201d; Jenna said with a laugh.<br> <br>The late-afternoon sun made the whole place aglow with a magical light. With the narrow streets and weathered buildings, there was a real sense that you were walking the same streets that people had walked two hundred years ago.<br> <br>Bess read my mind. &#x201c;If it weren&#x2019;t for the cars, I&#x2019;d almost feel like we&#x2019;d gone back to the past,&#x201d; she sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna nodded. &#x201c;As a history buff, it&#x2019;s one of the things I love most about this place. It&#x2019;s very dedicated to preserving the past. Take its whaling history. The island was originally settled in 1659 as a whaling colony. Nantucket dominated the trade for almost two hundred years. Given how people feel about whaling now&#x2014;and the fact that it almost drove whales to extinction&#x2014;some places might try to hide its association, but Nantucket has a museum with a permanent exhibit on whaling right in the center of town.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re definitely going to get that job,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;I usually think history is boring. I&#x2019;m all about the future&#x201d;&#x2014;she waved her smartphone in the air&#x2014;&#x201c;but you make it seem really cool.&#x201d;<br> <br>Down the street, a woman who looked to be about Jenna&#x2019;s age walked toward us, pushing a man in a wheelchair. Jenna&#x2019;s face lit up in a big smile, and she waved. The woman stopped, and Jenna introduced us.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Marni, my best friend on Nantucket, and this is her grandfather, Mr. Fraiser,&#x201d; Jenna told us. We all shook hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Fraiser is my favorite person on the island. Can you guess why?&#x201d; Jenna asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s the oldest person on the island?&#x201d; George asked, half under her breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;George!&#x201d; Bess hissed, hitting her.<br> <br>Jenna laughed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. It&#x2019;s true. He&#x2019;s a hundred and four!&#x201d;<br> <br>My jaw dropped. I couldn&#x2019;t help it. I&#x2019;d never met anyone over ninety before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Congratulations!&#x201d; George said.<br> <br>Mr. Fraiser nodded, but he seemed to be thinking about something else. I couldn&#x2019;t blame him. He was 104. He&#x2019;d earned the right to think about whatever he wanted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not only that,&#x201d; Jenna continued, &#x201c;but Marni&#x2019;s family has lived on the island for seven generations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; George exclaimed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like island royalty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, we don&#x2019;t get crowns,&#x201d; Marni said with a chuckle, &#x201c;just bragging rights.&#x201d; <br> <br>Bess checked the time. &#x201c;Jenna, it&#x2019;s five twenty-seven. We should probably go if we&#x2019;re going to make the banner hanging.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna nodded. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;We have to head home,&#x201d; Marni said. <br> <br>A disappointed look flitted across Jenna&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You do?&#x201d; she asked, confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Grandpa&#x2019;s pretty tired. The sneak peek at the exhibit earlier wore him out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenna seemed a little upset, but she mustered a smile. &#x201c;Okay. Well, I hope you liked it. Sorry I had to leave before you finished seeing all of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marni gave a nod. &#x201c;No problem. Once Grandpa&#x2019;s settled, how about I come join you guys for dinner?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Jenna said. Marni headed off, pushing her grandfather.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t envy her having to push that wheelchair on these cobblestones,&#x201d; I observed. Marni seemed out of breath after only a few steps.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s used to it,&#x201d; Jenna said. <br> <br>We walked quickly, and after two blocks, Jenna stopped us. &#x201c;Here we are,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>We were standing in front of a large brick building. A mural depicting a boat chasing a whale with a harpooner at the ready was on one of the outside walls. It was captioned Going on the Whale. Leaning out of a window near the top of the building was a kind-�looking middle-aged man hanging a banner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh good, you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; the man called down to Jenna. &#x201c;I was getting worried!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I wouldn&#x2019;t miss this, Pete!&#x201d; Jenna yelled back. <br> <br>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a guy leaning on the corner of a building, watching Pete hang the banner. The guy kept checking his phone and seemed fidgety.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does he look like he&#x2019;s up to something?&#x201d; I asked Bess, nodding toward the guy.<br> <br>She laughed. &#x201c;Nancy, you&#x2019;re on vacation. I order you to relax.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew she was right. I was making something into a big deal when nothing had even happened. My brain just wasn&#x2019;t used to not having a case to solve. That man was probably waiting for his date to arrive or something.<br> <br>Pete looked down at Jenna from the window and gave her a thumbs-up. &#x201c;Just a few more seconds,&#x201d; he shouted. It took all my willpower not to turn and see how Mr. Fidgety reacted to this news, but I could feel Bess&#x2019;s eyes on me, and I wanted to prove to her that I could be on a real vacation&#x2014;detective work not included.<br> <br>&#x201c;You ready?&#x201d; Pete shouted at Jenna.<br> <br>Jenna nodded, turning to Bess. &#x201c;Can you take a picture on your phone? I know my parents are going to want to see this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course!&#x201d; Bess said, getting herself into position.<br> <br>&#x201c;On the count of three,&#x201d; Pete yelled down. &#x201c;One . . . two . . . three.&#x201d;<br> <br>He unfurled the banner. It dropped down the side of the building, billowing with a satisfying whoosh. When it finally fell into place, a gasp went through the crowd that had gathered outside the museum.<br> <br>The banner advertised MYSTERY OF THE ELEANORE SHARPE SOLVED!<br> <br>But written across it in bright-red letters was the word LIAR!</p><h2>Eight Ate: A Feast of Homonym Riddles</h2><p>This collection of original riddles is unlike any other because the main words in each answer sound exactly alike, but have different meanings.

Once they put a hamster on my chest and when I bolted upright (my throat muscles paralyzed with fright) they asked, &#x201c;Do you have any alcohol for the chemistry set?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I suppose that&#x2019;s better than having them kick the wall until Daddy becomes conscious, then ask, &#x201c;Do you want the cardboards that the laundry puts in your shirts?&#x201d; Any wrath beats waking Daddy. There has to be something wrong with a man who keeps resetting his alarm clock in the morning and each time it blasts off smacks it silent and yells, &#x201c;No one tells me what to do, Buddy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Personally I couldn&#x2019;t care less what little games my husband plays with his alarm clock, but when I am awakened at 5:30, 6:00, 6:15, and 6:30 every morning, I soon react to bells like a punchy fighter. That&#x2019;s what I get for marrying a nocturnal animal. In the daylight, he&#x2019;s nothing. He has to have help with his shoelaces. In all the years we&#x2019;ve been married he only got up once of his own accord before 9:30. And then his mattress was on fire. He can&#x2019;t seem to cope with daytime noises like flies with noisy chest colds, the crash of marshmallows as they hit the hot chocolate, the earsplitting noises milk makes when you pour it over the cereal.<br> &nbsp;<br> The truth of it is, he&#x2019;s just not geared to function in an eight-to-five society. Once he even fell out of his filing cabinet. Around eleven at night a transformation takes place. He stretches and yawns, then his eyes pop open and he kicks me in the foot and says, &#x201c;What kind of a day did you have?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean we&#x2019;re still on the same one?&#x201d; I yawn.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to bed already, are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would it bother you if I played the guitar?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, then maybe I&#x2019;ll read a little before I go to sleep.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not? I have the only eyelids in the neighborhood with a tan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> No doubt about it, if I could arise in a graceful manner, I could cope.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s starting to snow. Thanks a lot up there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before moving to the suburbs, I always thought an &#x201c;Act of God&#x201d; was a flash of lightning at Mt. Sinai or forty days and forty nights of rain. Out here, they call a snowfall an &#x201c;Act of God&#x201d; and they close the schools.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first time it happened I experienced a warm, maternal glow, a feeling of confidence that I lived in a community which would put its children above inclement weather. The second time, that same week, I experienced a not-so-warm glow, but began to wonder if perhaps the kids could wear tennis rackets on their feet and a tow rope around their waists to guide them. On the third day school was canceled within a two-week period, I was organizing a dog-sled pool.<br> &nbsp;<br> We racked up fifteen Acts of God that year and it became apparent to the women in our neighborhood that &#x201c;somebody up there&#x201d; was out to get us.<br> &nbsp;<br> It got to be a winter morning ritual. We&#x2019;d all sit around the radio like an underground movement in touch with the free world. When the announcer read the names of the schools closed, a rousing cheer would go up and the kids would scatter. I&#x2019;d cry a little in the dishtowel, then announce sullenly, &#x201c;All right, don&#x2019;t sweat in the school clothes. REPEAT. Don&#x2019;t sweat in the school clothes. Hang them up. Maybe tomorrow you&#x2019;ll visit school. And stay out of those lunch boxes. It&#x2019;s only eight-thirty.&#x201d; My words would fall on deaf ears. Within minutes they were in full snow gear ready to whip over to the school and play on the hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> Little things began to bother me about these unscheduled closings. For example, we&#x2019;d drive by the school and our second-grader would point and ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that building, Daddy?&#x201d; Also, it was March and they hadn&#x2019;t had their Christmas exchange yet. Our ten-year-old had to be prompted with his alphabet. And the neighborhood &#x201c;Love and Devotion to Child Study&#x201d; group had to postpone their meetings three times because they couldn&#x2019;t get the rotten kids out from under foot.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We might as well be living in Fort Apache,&#x201d; said one mother. &#x201c;If this snow doesn&#x2019;t melt soon, my kid will outgrow his school desk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We all agreed something had to be done.<br> &nbsp;<br> This year, a curious thing happened. In the newspaper it was stated that snow was no longer to be considered an Act of God by the state board of education. Their concern was that the children spend a minimum number of hours in school each week and that the buses would roll come yells or high water.<br> &nbsp;<br> Snow is a beautiful, graceful thing as it floats downward to the earth, and is enhanced greatly by the breathtaking indentation of school bus snow tires. Snow is now considered an Act of Nature in the suburbs. And everyone knows she&#x2019;s a Mother and understands these things.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whip it up, group. Everyone to the boots!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you mean you&#x2019;re a participle in the school play and you need a costume? You be careful in that attic, do you hear? If you fall through and break your neck, you&#x2019;re going to be late for school!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A drudge. That&#x2019;s all I am. They&#x2019;ll all be sorry when I&#x2019;m not around to run and fetch.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So you swallowed the plastic dinosaur out of the cereal box. What do you want me to do, call a vet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lunches. Better pack the lunches. Listen to them bicker. What do they care what I pack? They&#x2019;d trade their own grandmother for a cough drop and a Holy picture.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, none of these things would bother me if I had an understanding husband. Mother was right. I should have married that little literature major who broke out in a rash every time he read Thoreau. But no, I had to pick the nut standing out in the driveway yelling at the top of his voice, &#x201c;I am thirty-nine years old. I make fifteen thousand dollars a year. I will not carry a Donald Duck thermos to the office!&#x201d; Boy, he wouldn&#x2019;t yell at me if my upper arms weren&#x2019;t flabby. He never used to yell at me like that. He should worry. He doesn&#x2019;t have to throw himself across the washer during &#x201c;spin&#x201d; to keep it from walking out of the utility room. He doesn&#x2019;t have to flirt with a hernia making bunk beds. He doesn&#x2019;t have to shuffle through encyclopedias before the school bus leaves to find out which United States president invented the folding chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s probably the weather. &#x201c;Everybody out!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Look at &#x2019;em stumbling around the driveway like newborn field mice. It&#x2019;s the weather all right. No leaves on the trees. No flowers. No green grass. Just a big picture window with nothing to look at but&nbsp;...&nbsp;a new bride moving into the cul-de-sac! Well, there goes the neighborhood. Would you look at her standing at her husband&#x2019;s elbow as he stencils their marvy new name on their marvy new garbage cans? I suppose tomorrow she&#x2019;ll be out waxing her driveway. So give her a few years, and she&#x2019;ll be like the rest of us sifting through the coffee grounds looking for baby&#x2019;s pacifier.<br> &nbsp;<br> What am I saying? Give her a few years of suburban living and she&#x2019;ll misplace the baby! What was it I was supposed to look for this morning? Maybe I&#x2019;ll think of it. I wonder how much time I waste each day looking for lost things. Let&#x2019;s see, I spent at least two hours yesterday looking for the bananas and enough straight pins to pin up a hem. Lucky the kids came up with the idea of walking across the floor in my bare feet or I&#x2019;d be looking for pins yet. I suppose I could&#x2019;ve uncovered the bananas by smelling breaths, but you have to trust someone sometime when they say no.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Infamous: Chronicles of Nick (Chronicles of Nick, 3)</h2><p><p>The world has fallen in love with Nick Gautier and the Dark-Hunters.</p><p>Now Nick's saga continues in the next eagerly anticipated volume...</p><p>Go to school.

It includes pertinent information on every major vaccine: polio, tetanus, MMR, hepatitis A, B, HPV (cervical cancer), Hib, Flu, chickenpox, shingles, rotavirus, pneumococcal, meningococcal, RSV, DTaP, anthrax, smallpox, TB, and more. All of the information, including detailed vaccine safety and efficacy data, is written in an easy-to-understand format, yet includes more than 1,000 scientific citations. More than 100 charts, tables, graphs and illustrations supplement the text. This encyclopedic health manual is an important addition to every family's home library and will be referred to again and again.</p></p><p>The author spent nearly three years researching vaccine studies from around the world and summarizing them in this monumental work. Each chapter in this Vaccine Safety Manual begins with a definition of the particular disease for which a vaccine has been developed, including data on who is most at risk, disease prevalence and severity. The vaccine for each disease is then analyzed according to its safety and efficacy profile. The safety sections include studies documenting vaccine-associated morbidity and mortality, as well as several personal stories from vaccine victims attesting to the real toll on human lives. Some chapters also include case histories from the U.S. government&#39;s own national database of vaccine damage -- VAERS. The efficacy sections analyze data from multiple sources to reveal the prophylactic potential of each vaccine: how likely it is to protect against the disease and reduce its incidence throughout society. Excerpts from congressional hearings, and vaccine debacles of historical significance, are included in this book as well. Charts, graphs, tables and other illustrations supplement the text for added comprehension.I have been investigating vaccines for more than 20 years. When my son was born, the matter became important to me. I began by studying medical and scientific journals. The data was disturbing. Evidence showed that vaccines are often unsafe and ineffective. In fact, some vaccines cause new diseases. I was even more shocked to learn that powerful people within the organized medical profession are aware of vaccine safety and protection deficiencies, but seem to have an implicit agreement to obscure facts, alter truth, and deceive the public. Vaccine failings are minimized while benefits are exaggerated to avert any negative publicity that might frighten concerned parents, threaten the vaccine program and lower vaccination rates. My first book, Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? was written to provide parents with a summary of my initial findings. <p>I wrote this current book, Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners (new, updated 2nd edition), to counterbalance conventional dogma. I researched vaccine studies and articles from around the world, then summarized them for your benefit. All of the data is footnoted in the text and referenced. The information I uncovered does not support the oft-heard claim that vaccine benefits outweigh their risks.

Ozzy was relieved when the wizard, Rin, agreed to help him find his kidnapped scientist parents, though the search was a wild series of close calls the closer they got to the truth. And although Rin had plenty of wise sayings, Ozzy doubted that Rin was an actual wizard.</p> <p>Now, on one dark and windy night, Ozzy steps out of bed, jumps out his window, and walks straight into the ocean. It's as if someone is controlling Ozzy's mind. He's saved by Sigi Rin's daughter and Clark, a mechanical robot bird. More than ever, Ozzy could really use the services of Rin, the Wizard for Hire.<br> <br> When a mysterious package arrives in the mail containing a plane ticket and a thumb drive, Ozzy is certain it's from Rin. But when Ozzy, Sigi, and Clark arrive in New York, Rin isn't there. Instead they are met by the man who was the money behind the mind-controlling discipline serum created by Ozzy's parents. Ozzy was the final test case and is now the key to discovering the serum's secret. He is a very valuable boy. Once again, he's on the run.<br> &nbsp;<br> As fate would have it, Rin appears just in time. But Rin's goal is more than a rescue mission. He needs an apprentice to cement his status and notoriety in the magical realm of Quarfelt assuming the place even exists. As Rin's apprentice, Ozzy must complete five tasks to receive the Gift of Wonder. Ozzy is willing to help, but is now really the best time to enter a contest for wizards when something is controlling his mind?

Besides traveling and writing, he enjoys solving mysteries and collecting old maps. He is the bestselling author of the Leven Thumps series. Skye believes imagination is one of the most powerful things in the world because it's the vehicle that opens your mind to the impossible.<br>"There are two kinds of people in the moody, magical world of <i>Apprentice Needed</i> those who are opposed to imagination, and those who understand what a powerful force it can be. The second novel in the Wizard for Hire series revisits the adventures of Ozzy, the wizard Rin, and a mechanical bird named Clark as they try to uncover the origins of a mysterious mind-control serum. Obert Skye has created a believable, lively world of magic and make-believe.<br><br> Whatever Rin's shortcomings, he has one great strength: he believes in Ozzy and magic, and is willing to power through whatever wild goose chase lies ahead. Sigi, Rin's daughter, is especially well-drawn, and her droll adolescent attitude is a nice foil for her dad's aggressive optimism. --Forward Reviews<br><br>This main plot would be sufficient to support the entire novel, but a second story is Turduckened inside it: Rin wants Ozzy to become his apprentice so that he can move on to the next level of wizardry. Both of these plots are well-developed...<i>Apprentice For Hire</i> is an ambitious second book that is full of wonderful, transporting exposition and realistic characters who pursue better-than-realistic adventures." --Foreword Reviews<br><br>"It's the characters that...make the book work. Clark is an amusing diversion with his dry humor and obsession with mechanical objects. While Rin's suspicious lack of magical ability throws his wizardry into question, Ozzy's continuing wonder with the world is the real magic.

He was re-discovering his youth, a part of his life he never discussed during his 61 years, many spent as one of the greatest talents in the history of pro wrestling. Following his death due to a heart attack that July,&nbsp;two of his children took on the job of telling Roddy's story, separating fact from fiction in the extraordinary life of their father. <br><br>Already an accomplished wrestler before Wrestlemania in 1985, Roddy Piper could infuriate a crowd like no "heel" before him. The principal antagonist to all-American champion Hulk Hogan, Piper used his quick wit, explosive ring style and fearless baiting of audiences to push pro wrestling to unprecedented success. Wrestling was suddenly pop culture's main event. An actor with over 50 screen credits, including the lead in John Carpenter's #1 cult classic, <i>They Live</i>, Piper knew how to keep fans hungry, just as he'd kept them wishing for a complete portrait of his most unusual life. He wanted to write this book for his family; now they have written it for him.</p><p>ARIEL TEAL TOOMBS is an actress and singer in Los Angeles, California. She is the middle daughter of Roddy Piper.<br><br>COLT BAIRD TOOMBS was an undefeated amateur MMA fighter, who has turned his attention toward professional wrestling. He is the son of Roddy Piper and lives in in Portland, Oregon.WCW had absorbed the old Mid-Atlantic Wrestling and turned Jim Crockett&#x2019;s Starrcade into its own premier annual event. It took place in December, far from McMahon&#x2019;s early spring WrestleMania. In the 1996 edition, Roddy Piper settled the old score once and for all. He caught &#x201c;Hollywood&#x201d; Hulk Hogan in a sleeper and won Starrcade&#x2019;s main event. During the bout, Hogan had put him in an abdominal stretch, which made Roddy&#x2019;s large hip-surgery scar fully visible to the cameras. Roddy had asked him to do that, and also to hike up his trunks to show it off clearly. At another moment, Roddy hopped around on that leg to further make an important point. Not McMahon&nbsp;nor any other promoter could ever cast doubt on Roddy&#x2019;s ability to wrestle on that titanium hip. <br><br>Before Roddy put the sleeper on Hogan, an imposing new member of the NWO had tried to interfere in the match, attacking Roddy and lifting him several feet off the mat for his signature chokeslam. The Giant was the biggest wrestler to hit the big time since Andre (in fact, Roddy escaped his grasp by dipping into his old giant-fighting toolkit, biting him on the nose to make him let go). Behind the scenes, the seven-foot rookie and the much smaller veteran had made fast friends. <br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a story Big Show tells in front of God and everyone,&#x201d; said Roddy (The Giant would change his name to Big Show when later wrestling in the WWE). Big Show told us the story himself. <br><br>&#x201c;I was green as grass. I was driving in on a Sunday night into Wisconsin and I got in really late.&#x201d; Tired from the road, he went to the hotel&#x2019;s front desk. The lady working the night shift said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so big, I&#x2019;m going to give you a suite.&#x201d; Grateful, he went up to the room. It was large and full of amenities. He went to the bathroom and splashed his face with cold water. &#x201c;I was drying my face and I look and there&#x2019;s a leather jacket hanging on one of the chairs.&#x201d; Figuring a previous occupant had left the jacket, he dismissed it and went to the bedroom. As he opened the French doors he heard somebody snoring, &#x201c;like the entire room was being sawed in half.&#x201d; On the nightstand was a bottle of NyQuil, and face-down on the bed, butt naked, was Roddy Piper. <br><br><i>Oh my God</i>, he thought, <i>that&#x2019;s Roddy Piper. This is awkward</i>. They&#x2019;d never met, but he&#x2019;d grown up watching Roddy on television. <br><br>&#x201c;So I quietly shut the doors, took my bags, meandered back downstairs. I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, ma&#x2019;am, but there&#x2019;s somebody in that room.&#x2019;&#x201d; She apologized and gave him another.<br><br>The next day he went to the WCW Nitro set and saw Roddy backstage. <br><br>&#x201c;I think nobody understands what an incredibly nice guy he was all the time,&#x201d; said Show. &#x201c;I mean so very humble, so very polite, and just set an example of what a superstar should be . . . the kindest, nicest person you could ever be around.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Roddy Piper,&#x201d; he said to the towering kid. <br><br>&#x201c;I met you last night,&#x201d; said The Giant. <br><br>&#x201c;You did?! When?&#x201d; said Roddy, slapping his head in embarrassment for forgetting. <br><br>The Giant told him the whole story and Roddy smiled at him. &#x201c;Ah, brother, you could have had me last night!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I remember thinking to myself as a young kid, about twentyfour years old, I go, &#x2018;Oh . . . whaaat?&#x2019;&#x201d; As The Giant settled into the business and got to know the habits of his fellow wrestlers, he realized what Roddy had meant. &#x201c;I could have ribbed him to death. I could have stolen his jacket. I could have written all over him with a Sharpie.&#x201d; <br><br>Every time they saw each other for the next twenty years, Roddy would wag his finger at him and smile, &#x201c;Brother, you could have had me!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;As I got older in the business, there&#x2019;s no way in hell I would have ever ribbed Roddy Piper anyway,&#x201d; he said, because the payback &#x201c;would have probably put me in therapy! You don&#x2019;t mess with the old-timers like that.&#x201d; <br><br>A middle-aged wrestler, now, the kind of star who used to beat him up many years ago, Roddy was instead winning fans among the new generation, even as he was losing the very first of the generation that raised him.</p><h2>The Journey: A Roadmap for Self-healing After Narcissistic Abuse</h2><p>There is currently a silent pandemic leaving millions of people feeling alone and confused, struggling to escape the self-doubt, fear and so many unanswered questions.

Two years, 75 games, 2,642 correct answers, and over $2.5 million in winnings later, Ken Jennings emerged as trivia&#x2019;s undisputed king. <i>Brainiac</i> traces his rise from anonymous computer programmer to nerd folk icon. But along the way, it also explores his newly conquered kingdom: the world of trivia itself.<br><br>Jennings had always been minutiae-mad, poring over almanacs and TV Guide listings at an age when most kids are still watching Elmo and putting beans up their nose. But trivia, he has found, is centuries older than his childhood obsession with it. Whisking us from the coffeehouses of seventeenth-century London to the Internet age, Jennings chronicles the ups and downs of the trivia fad: the quiz book explosion of the Jazz Age; the rise, fall, and rise again of TV quiz shows; the nostalgic campus trivia of the 1960s; and the 1980s, when Trivial Pursuit� again made it fashionable to be a know-it-all.<br>Jennings also investigates the shadowy demimonde of today&#x2019;s trivia subculture, guiding us on a tour of trivia hotspots across America. He goes head-to-head with the blowhards and diehards of the college quiz-bowl circuit, the slightly soused faithful of the Boston pub trivia scene, and the raucous participants in the annual Q&amp;A marathon in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, &#x201c;The World&#x2019;s Largest Trivia Contest.&#x201d; And, of course, he takes us behind the scenes of his improbable 75-game run on Jeopardy!<br><br>But above all, <i>Brainiac </i>is a love letter to the useless fact. What marsupial has fingerprints that are indistinguishable from human ones?* What planet has a crater on it named after Laura Ingalls Wilder?** What comedian had the misfortune to be born with the name &#x201c;Albert Einstein&#x201d;?*** Jennings also ponders questions that are a little more philosophical: What separates trivia from meaningless facts? Is being good at trivia a mark of intelligence? And is trivia just a waste of time, or does it serve some not-so-trivial purpose after all?<br><br>Uproarious, silly, engaging, and erudite, this book is an irresistible celebration of nostalgia, curiosity, and nerdy obsession&#x2013;in a word, trivia.<br><br><b>* The koala<br>** Venus<br>*** Albert Brooks</b></p><p>Ken Jennings was born in Seattle but spent much of his childhood in Seoul, South Korea. A graduate of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, he worked as a computer programmer until becoming an unlikely celebrity due to his unprecedented record-breaking streak on the television quiz show Jeopardy! He lives outside Salt Lake City with his wife and son.

The red rock country of southern Utah is red for the same reason that the planet Mars has a pinkish tinge when you see it in the night sky: both are loaded with iron oxide, a.k.a. ordinary household rust. The shadows of these red desert crags are lengthening toward our car as it pulls into a dusty gas station on the Utah-Arizona border. The air smells of diesel fumes and sagebrush when I open the passenger-side door. My friend Earl Cahill unfolds himself from the driver's seat, relieved we've made it to this, our last chance at gas for fifty miles. <br>Earl is my old college roommate, and though he's a remarkable six-foot-nine in height, he's one of those giants who hope that by holding their head and shoulders at just the right dejected angle, they may somehow&#x2014;if not disappear completely&#x2014;at least give the appearance of being only six-foot-four or six-foot-five. He blinks into the setting sun through the shock of floppy brown hair hanging over his face, a face that bears the perpetually disappointed look of an English foxhound or a Cubs fan. <br>As I pump gas, we re-enact the ritual of all road-trippers since the days of Jack Kerouac, and try to figure out how we're going to divvy up the trip's costs. Unlike our beatnik freeway forefathers, however, Earl and I are both computer programmers, and we're driving down to Los Angeles not to hear jazz or harvest lettuce or watch the sun set over the Pacific, but to try to land spots on <i>Jeopardy!</i>, America's most popular and most difficult quiz show. Appropriately, geekily, we are squabbling about the most <i>elegant algorithm</i> to calculate and divide up our expenses. <br>"How about this?" I offer. "There's two of us, so that vastly improves our chances that one of us will make it on the show, right? And, as we know, that person is guaranteed at least a thousand dollars, even if he finishes in third place. So here's what we do: we split all expenses when we get back, but if one of us makes it on the show, that person pays for the other's share of gas and other expenses from this trip." <br>Earl's brow furrows, suspicious he's being conned. <br>"It's no-lose," I persist. "If you get on the show, you pay for all expenses, but you still turn a big profit from your winnings. The one who doesn't get on loses nothing." <br>"Deal," he finally agrees. We shake on it as we switch spots and climb back into the car. It <i>is</i> a no-lose scenario, but I'm guessing that I'll end up being the beneficiary of my own plan. Earl, I figure, is exactly the type game shows look for. Besides being incredibly smart and, as he likes to put it, "sideshow-freak tall," he has a booming baritone voice and an eccentric way of speaking&#x2014;an inside-joke-rich patois of computer-hacker lingo, <i>Simpsons</i> references and, mysteriously, quotes from Merchant Ivory movies. He's exactly the kind of larger-than-life personality <i>Jeopardy!</i> needs&#x2014;a lock to get on the show. I figure I've just negotiated myself a free trip to L.A. <br>But, I admit to myself, I'm not just along for the ride as Earl's road-trip buddy. For as long as I can remember, I've dreamed of being on <i>Jeopardy!</i>, and Earl knows it. "You know," he says, "I keep telling myself that even if I fail the test, at least I can tell people I was the guy that got Ken Jennings on <i>Jeopardy!</i>" We pull back onto I-15 and drive off into the sunset. <br>* * * *<br>I've been meaning to try out for <i>Jeopardy!</i> for twenty years now, but I've loved trivia for even longer. My generation tends to think of trivia as an eighties craze, something we cherish nostalgically in the same neurons of our brain responsible for remembering Members Only jackets and Ralph Macchio. The watershed trivia year of my youth was clearly 1984, the year that the Alex Trebek version of <i>Jeopardy!</i> debuted on the airwaves and Trivial Pursuit sold twenty million copies, supplanting Pac-Man as <i>the</i> game craze of the era. But ask someone ten years younger what year trivia peaked, and her "final answer" would probably be 1999 or so, when <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i> became so explosively popular. Someone of my parents' generation might associate the word "trivia" with the vogue for college campus trivia contests in the late 1960s, while my grandparents would certainly remember America holding its breath as contestants sweated it out in isolation booths on the high-rated (and highly rigged) TV quiz shows of the 1950s. A scholar in the field might even point you back to 1927, when the best-selling book <i>Ask Me Another!</i> ignited the very first question-and-answer craze in America. If trivia is a fad, in other words, it's certainly a pesky one. Like the Terminator, Halley's Comet, or genital herpes, trivia just keeps coming back. <br>And it's still around. In fact, though trivia isn't necessarily faddish at the moment, it's still somehow omnipresent. America plays hundreds of thousands of trivia games every day&#x2014;in urban bars, on suburban coffee tables, on FM radio stations, on cell phones. Trivia appears on our beer coasters, under our Snapple caps, on our Cracker Jack prizes. It clogs our e-mail inboxes and magazine article sidebars. It fills the blank space at the bottom of columns in the phone book. It pacifies us while we watch the cola-sponsored advertising on movie screens. It's the bumper that takes us to commercial on cable news and entertainment shows. It's such a familiar part of American life that we don't even notice it anymore, and yet there it always is. We live surrounded by trivia. <br>"Trivia," the word itself, pre-dates 1984 and Trivial Pursuit, of course. In fact, it goes back millennia. Originally a Roman name for the goddess Hecate, in her role as guardian of the crossroads, "Trivia" derives from the Latin "trivium": a crossroads where "three ways" met. Centuries later, English writer John Gay named his most famous poem, a 1716 description of a walking tour of London, "Trivia," in honor of the same goddess. (Gay is better known for his satirical <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>, the musical work upon which Brecht's <i>Threepenny Opera</i> was based, which means he's also responsible for the pop song that was the #1 <i>Billboard</i> hit of 1959.)1 <br>The Latin word "trivium" is also our source for the adjective form "trivial," meaning unimportant or ordinary. It's generally believed that "trivial" came to mean commonplace because a "trivium" or public crossroads was, literally, a "common place." Others claim that the adjective "trivial" derives from another use of "trivium"&#x2014;in medieval universities, the course load was divided between the three-subject trivium and the four-subject quadrivium. The trio of courses in the trivium was always grammar, rhetoric, and logic, while the quadrivium was composed of home ec, driver's ed, wood shop, and band (oh, all right: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.) The trivium contained the easier, more elementary subjects, thought to be less important than the advanced quadrivium, and, hence, "trivial." <br>In the 20th century, the noun form "trivia" first began to be used as a derivative of "trivial" to refer to trifles, or things deemed unimportant. As early as 1902, popular essayist Logan Pearsall Smith (the brother-in-law, incidentally, of philosopher Bertrand Russell) published a bestselling collection of brief philosophical musings under the title <i>Trivia</i>. But the word didn't adopt its current usage&#x2014;"questions and answers about unusual bits of everyday knowledge"&#x2014;until the mid-1960s. <br>I've always felt it was a shame that the "trivia" moniker stuck to trivia so firmly. Referring to your hobby with a word that quite literally means "petty" or "insignificant" doesn't strike me as the best way to popularize it. Would football ever have caught on if gridiron fans insisted on calling it "that stupid sport with the weird-shaped ball"? Do philatelists call postage stamps "little gummed squares that we pointlessly collect and pore over when we really should be out meeting girls"? And yet trivia fans happily adopt the language of the oppressor, tacitly but cheerfully agreeing that, yes, their tendency toward learning and knowing lots of weird stuff is completely valueless. Completely "trivial." <br>I first heard the words "trivial" and "nontrivial" in their scientific usage in the math and computer science classes I took in college. To math and computer nerds, a trivial problem is one with a ridiculously easy solution, one the teacher probably won't even bother to put up on the overhead projector. Science is, instead, about the pursuit of the unusual, elegant solution&#x2014;the nontrivial one. For example, I remember learning once about "sum-product numbers," numbers equal to the sum of all their digits multiplied by the product of all their digits. There are an infinite number of numbers, said the instructor, but only three sum-product numbers. The number 1 is the trivial solution, the boring one: 1 � 1 = 1. The interesting solutions are the nontrivial ones&#x2014;135, for instance (though there's one other):2 <br>((1 + 3 + 5) � (1 � 3 � 5)) = 135 <br>Ever since I can remember, I've had the idea that trivia, despite its name, <i>is</i> elegant, complicated, fascinating, worthy of study&#x2014;that trivia is, in a word, nontrivial. <br><br>Answers<br>1 Bobby Darin's "Mack the Knife"<br>2 144 is as well</p><h2>When to Speak Up and When To Shut Up</h2><p>Almost everyone has found themselves in a situation where they don't know if they should bite their tongue or speak their mind.

When you base your purchase decisions on isolated facts and don't take the time to thoroughly understand the businesses you are buying, stock-price swings and third-party opinion can lead to costly investment mistakes. Your decision making at this point becomes dangerous because it is dominated by emotions. <i>The Investment Checklist</i> has been designed to help you develop an in-depth research process, from generating and researching investment ideas to assessing the quality of a business and its management team.</p> <p>The purpose of <i>The Investment Checklist</i> is to help you implement a principled investing strategy through a series of checklists. In it, a thorough and comprehensive research process is made simpler through the use of straightforward checklists that will allow you to identify quality investment opportunities.

In doing this, your decision-making process becomes dangerous because you haven't taken the time to thoroughly understand the businesses you are buying and you're relying on the information, or misinformation, being provided to you about a particular stock. Instead, your investment purchases should be based on understanding the value of a business through in-depth research. If you truly understand the value of a business, then you will be in a position to recognize investment opportunities and can more easily make the right buy or sell decisions.</p> <p>The Investment Checklist has been designed to help you develop an in-depth research process, through a series of checklists, that will allow you to effectively generate and research investment ideas, assess the quality of a business and its management team, and ultimately improve the performance of your portfolio. In it, author Michael Shearn&#x2014;founder of Time Value of Money, LP, and the Compound Money Fund, LP&#x2014;outlines the systematic process he has used over the past decade to carefully think through potential investments and avoid common investment mistakes. Along the way, he puts this approach in perspective by addressing:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A search strategy that will improve your odds of finding investment ideas worth researching further</p> </li> <li> <p>The importance of evaluating a business's strengths and weaknesses, measuring its operational and financial health, and understanding a business from the customers' perspective rather than your own</p> </li> <li> <p>Why assessing the quality of management&#x2014; from how they handle daily operations and long-term strategy to the type of managers they are and how they rose to lead the business&#x2014;are essential to achieving better investment results</p> </li> <li> <p>How to gauge the potential future growth opportunities of a business by looking at whether it's growing organically or through merger and acquisitions, and whether historical growth has been profitable</p> </li> <li> <p>And much more</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each chapter of The Investment Checklist also offers countless examples of companies the author has researched, considered investing in, and actually invested in or decided not to invest in. These examples show you exactly how his checklist helped him make investment decisions, and they'll show you how to do the same. In addition, each chapter ends with "Key Points to Keep in Mind," so you can zero in on the critical factors in each set of questions.</p> <p>If you want to lower your investment risk you need to increase your knowledge of the businesses you buy stock in. The Investment Checklist will show you how to do this, and much more, by helping you follow a concise and easy-to-use framework that will guide your investment decisions.</p><p>Praise forTHE INVESTMENT CHECKLIST</p> <p>"Every wise investor will keep The Investment Checklist next to their financial instrument panel and consult it whenever they make a decision to buy or sell a stock."&#x2014;Robert P.

Raising provocative questions about what qualifies as a language (so-called slang does have structured grammar), McWhorter takes readers on a marvelous journey through time and place&#x2014;from Persia to the languages of Sri Lanka&#x2014;to deliver a feast of facts about the wonders of human linguistic expression.</p><p>John McWhorter is the author of the bestseller <i>Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America</i>, <i>The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language</i>, and four other books. He is associate professor of linguistics at the University of California at Berkeley, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and a contributing editor to <i>The City Journal</i> and <i>The New Republic</i>. He has been profiled in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and has appeared on <i>Dateline NBC</i>, <i>Politically Incorrect</i>, and <i>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i>."Insightful...eye-opening, even liberating."<br><br>"The King''s English topples from the throne of linguistic legitimacy in this rollicking tour of human language. Columbia University linguist and bestselling author McWhorter ("Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America") surveys a Babel of languages from behemoths like Chinese to isolated, insanely complex Siberian languages, New World creoles, and unfairly disparaged street slangs. His approach is organic rather than prescriptive; he argues that languages are living entities that grow, mutate, and interbreed, creating new words and grammatical forms. The fluidity and incorrigible "disheveledness" of language, he contends, means that no linguistic practice is uniquely correct, least of all persnickety written standards that ignore spoken realities. An insightful chapter on African-American dialect analyzes it as a slightly simplified but equally expressive version of Standard English, shaped by the same pressures that make modern Hebrew a simplified version of the ancient tongue. McWhorter unearths a wealth of colorful linguistic facts (in the New Guinean language Berik, Nice to see you comes out as My gall bladder is really warm today), from which he distills larger principles, couching his erudition in a lucid, supple prose. The result is a fascinating romp through the ornery wonders of language."<br><br>"McWhorter...effectively focuses on the changeability of language, showing what happens when words wander and meanings morph. Languages are "living things," he reminds us. Borrowing Charles Darwin's closing words from "On the Origin of Species," he concludes that "today we have 'endless forms most beautiful and wonderful.'"--"The Washington Post"<br><br>"McWhorter walks through his five signal characteristics of language with a spring in his step and armed with a vast collection of interesting--and convincing--examples... "What Language Is "isn't another "oh, that wacky language!" book; its mission is far broader than just to give a tour of other languages' customs and habits. The crux of the book is Mr. McWhorter's insistence (shared by most linguists) on the oral language as the living, breathing language. He shows that most pedantic objections to language change are due to our insistence on holding on to the fixed form of the written language--fixed, that is, at some point just after we became competent writers and just before some change that we dislike."--"The Wall Street Journal"<br><br>"Energetic, brisk and often amusing analysis of how language works."--"The Columbus Dispatch"<br><br>"McWhorter boldly offers general readers another taste of language study. He presents a wealth of examples of English dialects when considering matters of grammar. These will fascinate, as will the similar development of two imperial languages, English and Persian... the distinctive blend of detail, accessible tone, and solid research will appeal to language students of all kinds."--"Library Journal"<br><br>"The King's English topples from the throne of linguistic legitimacy in this rollicking tour of human language.

From languages that change tone for different tenses to languages that do not have any regular verbs, this is an entertaining foray into what language is and what it is not. I look forward to reading more from this talented linguist."--Fran Wilson, Colorado State University Bookstore, Fort Collins, CO<br><br>"Insightful...eye-opening, even liberating."--"Kirkus Reviews"<br><br>"If there is something [John McWhorter] doesn't do well, we won't find it in his new work, "What Language Is" . . . And speaking of prose style, this book is an example of the sort of writing everyone should aspire to. . . . While language is ubiquitous, written ones are a minority. This book is a reason to consider ourselves fabulously fortunate." --"New York Journal of Books"</p><h2>Spartina</h2><p><b>Winner of the 1989 National Book Award</b><br><br>A classic tale of a man, a boat, and a storm, <b>Spartina</b> is the lyrical and compassionate story of Dick Pierce, a commercial fisherman along the shores of Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay. A kind, sensitive, family man, he is also prone to irascible outbursts against the people he must work for, now that he can no longer make his living from the sea.<br><br>Pierce's one great passion, a fifty-foot fishing boat called <i>Spartina</i>, lies unfinished in his back yard. Determined to get the funds he needs to buy her engine, he finds himself taking a foolish, dangerous risk. But his real test comes when he must weather a storm at sea in order to keep his dream alive. Moving and poetic, <i>Spartina</i> is a masterly story of one man's ongoing struggle to find his place in the world.</p><p>Dick Pierce, fisherman and boat-builder, lives on the Rhode Island shore in a backwater world of salt marshes, alcoholic fishermen, crab boats and old homesteads disappearing under new resorts for inland tourists. A stubborn man thoughtful enough to know that the world is becoming too small for men like himself, Pierce has a mortgage, a family, a "puny income from lobstering" and a dream: to finish the half-built boat in his backyard so he can fish for red crabs out in deep water, make some real money and raise himself and his family up. He is a classic American solitary hero, and Casey knows the sloughs of the Rhode Island shore as well as any fisherman. <i>Spartina</i> won the National Book Award in 1989."Possibly the best American novel since The Old Man and the Sea, maybe even Moby Dick." --The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Vivid . . . engrossing . . . old-fashioned, full-bodied fiction with a vengeance. . . . They do not make novels like this very much anymore." --Time</p><h2>The Book of Camping &amp; Woodcraft: A Guidebook For Those Who Travel In The Wilderness</h2><p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This description is for the 2011 reprint with the <strong>green and black cover</strong>, NOT the 2012 reprint with the brown cover "published" by RareBooksClub.com.

Kephart</em></p> <p>Intended as the definitive pocket field guide for the turn of the 20th Century woodsman and camper, the <em>The Book of Camping &amp; Woodcraft</em> was originally published in 1906. This particular "Heritage Edition" appears as it was on the second reprinting in 1910. In 1916, Kephart dramatically expanded the book into two volumes to include wagon camping and semi-permanent base camp construction. These are the equivalent of modern car camping - just a couple of notches down from a motel stay.

The stories collected in <i>The Push Man </i>are simultaneously haunting, disturbing, and darkly humorous. A lone man travels the country, projecting pornographic films for private individuals while attempting to maintain a normal home life. The lives of two men become intertwined when one hires the other to observe his sexual escapades through a telescope. An auto mechanic's obsession with a female TV personality turns fatal after a chance meeting between the two</p></p><p><p>Born in 1935, <b>Yoshihiro Tatsumi</b>, who has influenced generations of cartoonists, lives in Japan.</p>Starred Review. Tatsumi's brief, disturbing stories, originally published in 1969, have a tone somewhere between contemporary short fiction and EC Comics' old "shock" comics. Each hinges on some kind of prurient or sexually twisted situation: a man's bedridden lover turns out to be a physically mutated sex slave; an office worker puts on his girlfriend's makeup and clothes and has an affair with another woman; a man who disinfects telephones for a living calls a prostitute, but can't think of anything to do but pull out his disinfection kit. Produced over a short period of time, the stories are variations on a theme of social maladjustment. Tatsumi draws marvelously evocative settings, and his stories flow with dreamlike ambiguity, speeding toward the inevitable tragedies at their ends, but his characters appear practically identical. This reinforces both the repetitive nature of his themes and Tatsumi's view of the common man's continuing struggle in a merciless world of menial jobs, impotence and abortions. Tatsumi is known as the "grandfather of Japanese alternative comics," and this is the first in a proposed series of authorized English-language collections of his work. His work anticipates American alternative comics, making it clear why American cartoonist Adrian Tomine, who edited this collection, was attracted to the work. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Arriving in Washington, D.C., Joshua walks along Pennsylvania Avenue with a cool detachment and determination that sets him apart from the bustling crowds. Under ordinary circumstances, he would no doubt be seen simply as a man wrapped in his own thoughts. But in these security-obsessed times, his Middle Eastern appearance and his spontaneous stops at various churches, temples, and mosques inevitably arouse suspicions. Taken into custody by two government agents, Joshua challenges the legal and moral justness of their actions and they reluctantly release him to continue his mission.

He lives in Altamont, New York.Chapter 1<br><br>Pennsylvania avenue was flowing with pedestrians crisscrossing in every direction like a floating colony of ants. Busy and confusing as it was to the casual eye, one man in that vast crowd stood out. Calm, detached from all around him, he walked with determination. Under ordinary circumstances he would appear as just different, but in the current heavy atmosphere of political paranoia, the man&#x2019;s Middle Eastern appearance set him apart as possibly sinister. Though poorly dressed, he did not seem like a homeless beggar. His resolute gaze indicated he was a man with a purpose. What kind of purpose? Who was he? Where was he from? What was he doing at this particular time in Washington, D.C.? What made him stand out was his total lack of interest in the sights. Ordinary visitors gawked in every direction, unwilling to miss anything. This man appeared disinterested in everything around him. His detachment caused wonder and aroused suspicion in anyone whose concern was the security of the area. As the stranger walked closer and closer to the White House, he was approached by two neatly dressed men who asked for his identification. Of course, Joshua had none.<br><br>&#x201c;I think you better come with us,&#x201d; one of them said, flashing his badge as a government agent.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, what have I done?&#x201d; Joshua asked with a calm, confused look.<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind! Just come with us and don&#x2019;t give us any trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>As the three walked along, the younger of the two asked Joshua how long he had been in Washington. &#x201c;I just arrived,&#x201d; was the quick reply.<br><br>&#x201c;Where did you come from?&#x201d; was the next question.<br><br>Joshua&#x2019;s vague response told them nothing, increasing their suspicion. A black Ford pulled up along the curb. The driver emerged and opened the rear door. The two men directed Joshua to get in, then took their places on either side of him as the car sped off down the street to an FBI office.<br><br>Dan Halloran had been working for the Bureau for a little over a year, having finished his law degree at Georgetown just a few months before. His father had been in the military, spending his last years as a briefing officer at the Pentagon, so they had connections enough to find good positions for family members. Dan was dedicated to his new assignment of monitoring approaches to the White House. Like his father, he was clean-cut, rigid, seeing life in black and white, with no possibility of shades in between. His partner, Tom Clark, was older. He had been an agent for over ten years and was slightly more casual in the performance of his assigned duties, at least as casual as the agency&#x2019;s discipline would allow.<br><br>Sitting on one side of the table with Joshua sitting across from them, the two men interrogated him.<br><br>&#x201c;You said your name was Joshua?&#x201d; Dan Halloran asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is your last name?&#x201d; the agent continued.<br><br>&#x201c;I rarely use my last name,&#x201d; Joshua replied.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care whether you use it or not. What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ben-Youssef.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that Palestinian?&#x201d; Tom Clark asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;No, the name is Hebrew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hebrew? Sounds Arabic to me. Are you an American citizen?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I belong here, if that is what you are asking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Answer the question,&#x201d; Dan insisted. &#x201c;Are you an American? Do you have an American passport?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never needed one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is your nationality?&#x201d; Dan asked impatiently, realizing this was not going to be an easy day.<br><br>&#x201c;I have no nationality. I am a member of every family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re an illegal alien?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is your term. I am not illegal, nor am I here illegally. I have been here long before you were born.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you just being difficult? Or are you hiding something?&#x201d; Tom interjected.<br><br>&#x201c;I am hiding nothing. You are the ones who picked me off the street although I had done nothing wrong and have no intention of doing harm to anyone. Why do you suspect me? Because I am poor? Because I look like someone you prejudge to be evil? If I have done nothing wrong, then why do you interrogate me? You are the ones who are doing what is unjust, profiling people because of the way they look and the clothes they wear. Fear does terrible things to people, pushing ordinarily normal people into doing things that would be unthinkable in ordinary times. I am surprised and saddened that this could happen in this beautiful country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since you cannot prove your citizenship, you <i>must</i> be here illegally,&#x201d; Dan continued with mounting frustration.<br><br>&#x201c;How many people walking down Pennsylvania Avenue carry with them proof of citizenship? I am not alien to America. I have always been here, and I will always be here. Unless you can prove that I am an illegal alien, I ask that you release me.&#x201d;<br><br>Realizing that they were getting nowhere and that the man was right in saying they had no legal cause to hold him, they fingerprinted him, took his name, declined to demand his Social Security number, since it would be futile anyway, and released him. However, for the whole period of Joshua&#x2019;s stay, he was shadowed everywhere he went. His every movement was watched and recorded, his every word written down.<br><br>Joshua continued wandering through the city, casually enjoying the sights as he walked along, but without appearing to be a tourist stretching his neck to miss nothing. His real purpose was to meet certain individuals, and even though he had been sidetracked by his arrest, he knew just where he had to be and at precisely what times he should be there. Even this apparently unforeseen incident had been taken into consideration.<br><br>Joshua&#x2019;s encounter with the police plainly evidenced the threatening atmosphere pervading the country. It was not always like that, only during times of national stress when people&#x2019;s basic human rights are often trampled, and the lives of so many innocent people are destroyed, and their reputations and businesses are ruined by the all-pervasive paranoia. Certain government officials will have their way for a few years, then the people come to their senses and realize they have been blinded by zealots whose obsession threatens the rights of everyone. Then the life of the nation drifts back to normal. Hopefully this current obsession would also pass before it did more damage to people than the evil it was trying to prevent.<br><br>Continuing his walk around the city, Joshua turned up North Capitol, stopping at St. Aloysius Gonzaga, an old Jesuit church in the heart of the city. Knowing he was being followed, he gave no heed, for he had a much better surveillance system that made it possible for him to be always a giant step ahead of them. After entering the church, he looked around and spotted a man halfway up the middle aisle. He was kneeling with bowed head, deep in prayer. Joshua approached and tapped him on the shoulder. Startled, the man turned and looked up.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, what do you want?&#x201d; the man asked in a deep, brusque voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I have come to answer your prayer,&#x201d; Joshua replied.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know what I was praying for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are praying for your son. You are worried about him because of the company he has been keeping lately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it you have to tell me? But, first of all, who are you? What is your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My name is Joshua. And I know your son well. He is a good boy, and you are afraid that he is mixed up in something that will bring him harm and will bring shame upon your family. You are afraid something terrible is going to happen to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know all these things? I have never told a soul.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand. But I tell you your son is protected from above. Nothing evil will befall him. He is disturbed over the plight of your people and wants to do something heroic, but he has innocently approached the wrong people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, you are right. I know what you are saying. That is why I am so afraid. I have heard of those people. I grew up with some of them, but they are nothing like our family. We are a good, honest people, and hardworking. My son has always been a good boy. I pray to God that nothing will happen to him.&#x201d;<br><br>The man extended his hand to Joshua. &#x201c;My name is Benyamin. I came here years ago to escape trouble in my country. Bethlehem, where I lived, was supposed to be a city of peace, but we have never known a day of peace. I thought that if I brought my family here, we would find peace. For a while we did, but now it is all turning sour, and I am afraid things will get worse. People follow us because we look suspicious and our names are strange, and because we came from Palestine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Benyamin, do not worry! I know you well. You and your family are people of deep faith. God has something very special for your son to do. Do not worry about him! God has answered your prayers. Your son will be safe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; the man asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I know. Trust me. Go home and tell your wife to be at peace. All will be well with your son.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who you are, sir, or how you know, but you already make me feel at peace,&#x201d; the man said as tears began to flow down his cheeks.<br><br>As Joshua turned to leave the church, the man continued his prayers, this time thanking God for all His goodness.<br><br>As soon as Joshua stepped outside, he noticed the two agents casually watching from across the street. It brought back memories of days of old, when scribes and Pharisees and their henchmen followed him everywhere he went, jotting notes, cataloging his every move and everything he said and the names of the people close to him. He knew that this would be even more complicated because of the modern sophisticated eavesdropping equipment that made it possible for spies to snoop almost totally undetected. He would have to be careful, &#x201c;simple as a dove, sly as a fox.&#x201d; Yet it really did not trouble him; he was going to have fun, since he knew his own eavesdropping abilities were far superior to their electronic gadgets. He would have no trouble outfoxing them.<br><br>As Joshua continued his walk up North Capitol, he encountered a group of African-American children playing along the sidewalk. As he approached, the children stopped playing and stood watching him. Besides looking different, he seemed different in other ways, not like an American, but like a foreigner of some kind. It was an almost totally black neighborhood. Joshua noticed the surprised look on their faces and smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;Good day, little ones! You are such happy children. Always be happy. God made you to be happy. See all the beautiful things my Father has created just so you could enjoy them and be happy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What beautiful things?&#x201d; a skinny eight-year-old boy questioned cynically. &#x201c;Everything around here is dirty and noisy. Even the buildings are falling apart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it is sad, isn&#x2019;t it,&#x201d; Joshua replied. &#x201c;Someday you will live in a much nicer place, but even here there are beautiful things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; the boy asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about Semantha?&#x201d; who beamed when Joshua mentioned her name. &#x201c;And Hakim? What about him? He&#x2019;s beautiful, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She ain&#x2019;t beautiful. She&#x2019;s my sister. And Hakim? Hakim, yeah, man, you&#x2019;re beautiful. Wait till I tell everybody that this dude said you&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quit it, Charles, or I&#x2019;ll tell everybody you still suck your thumb.&#x201d;<br><br>Joshua smiled. &#x201c;You are all just having fun. Don&#x2019;t let your feelings get hurt when friends are playing with you. Just laugh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mister, who are you, anyway?&#x201d; Hakim asked. &#x201c;We never saw you around here before. Besides, you&#x2019;re white. White people don&#x2019;t walk around here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see color. I just see a beautiful creation of God. You are all beautiful. So, there are three things that are beautiful. Now look at that rosebush over there against the house. It&#x2019;s coming right out of the crack between the house and the concrete. Look at those roses, how red and brilliant they are. They even smell nice. Did you ever smell a rose?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Hakim replied.<br><br>After picking a rose off the bush, Joshua let them smell it.<br><br>&#x201c;That smells nice,&#x201d; Hakim said with surprise.<br><br>Then the others smelled it. &#x201c;Man, that smells pretty,&#x201d; Charles said.<br><br>Then Joshua gave the rose to Semantha. &#x201c;Here, Semantha, God let that rosebush grow right out of the concrete just so He would have something beautiful to show you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name? Who are you?&#x201d; Charles asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Joshua, that&#x2019;s my name. I have come to give people hope, to help them to be happy, because God wants His children to be happy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mister, even if you&#x2019;re not a brother, you&#x2019;re nice. Will we see you again?&#x201d; Hakim asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I think so, someday,&#x201d; Joshua replied.<br><br>Finally, Semantha spoke up. &#x201c;Joshua, how did you know our names when we didn&#x2019;t tell you?&#x201d;<br><br>Joshua just smiled and answered softly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve known you for a long time.&#x201d;<br><br>As he began to walk away, he told them, &#x201c;Be happy, always be happy, and be kind . . . even to those who may seem different and unimportant!&#x201d;<br><br>Joshua continued on his way. Stopping in front of a Baptist church not far up the street, he talked to a handful of people gathered around their minister, discussing possible renovations to the facade of their church.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; he said as he approached.<br><br>After turning to see who it was, one person returned the greeting. The others just continued their discussion. Joshua walked over to the man who greeted him.<br><br>&#x201c;My name is Joshua. Thank you for being kind enough to say hello,&#x201d; he said as he extended a hand.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m George, George Payne. I have to admit I was sort of surprised seeing someone who is not a brother walking down our neighborhood. Most people would be afraid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not afraid. I love all people. I see you are considering renovations to your church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, they&#x2019;re badly needed. Have been for a long time, but only lately do we have a little bit of money saved to do the job. But now we don&#x2019;t know where to start.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am sure you will do a good job. I&#x2019;ll pray for it, George. And thank you for being so gracious toward a stranger.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a nice man. May the Lord&#x2019;s peace be with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, and with you as well.&#x201d;<br><br>As Joshua continued on his walk, he noticed the agents still following him, at a supposedly discreet distance. He merely smiled, knowing he already had them confused. The walk up North Capitol past the old waterworks led to an entirely different atmosphere, of colleges, churches, and monasteries, with even more monasteries and churches than around the immediate vicinity of the Vatican. It was also the site of a relatively new sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary. As Joshua proceeded up the walkway toward the Romanesque marble structure, he knew this would completely baffle the agents following him. From a church where he talked to a Palestinian, to a Baptist church where he talked briefly to a black Baptist, and now to a Roman Catholic basilica. He knew what they were thinking: What do all these have in common? It doesn&#x2019;t make sense. What&#x2019;s his point? What is he doing now, at a Catholic place, after meeting an Arab man and stopping to talk at a black Baptist place?<br><br>Once inside the church, Joshua looked up at the huge, brilliant mosaic on the vaulted ceiling above the main altar. His peaceful look quickly changed to an uncomfortable grimace, showing his displeasure with the artist&#x2019;s idea of Jesus. Joshua knew that even at the Last Judgment, Jesus&#x2019; love and compassion would still triumph even as people&#x2019;s consciences convicted them of self-centered sinfulness in the presence of Eternal Goodness.</p><h2>The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees: The Ash in Human Culture and History</h2><p><p><strong>The story of how one man cut down a single tree to see how many things could be made from it.</strong></p><p>Out of all the trees in the world, the ash is most closely bound up with who we are: the tree we have made the greatest and most varied use of over the course of human history. One frigid winter morning, Robert Penn lovingly selected an ash tree and cut it down. He wanted to see how many beautiful, handmade objects could be made from it.</p><p>Thus begins an adventure of craftsmanship and discovery. Penn visits the shops of modern-day woodworkers&#x2015;whose expertise has been handed down through generations&#x2015;and finds that ancient woodworking techniques are far from dead. He introduces artisans who create a flawless axe handle, a rugged and true wagon wheel, a deadly bow and arrow, an Olympic-grade toboggan, and many other handmade objects using their knowledge of ash&#x2019;s unique properties. Penn connects our daily lives back to the natural woodlands that once dominated our landscapes.</p><p>Throughout his travels&#x2015;from his home in Wales, across Europe, and America&#x2015;Penn makes a case for the continued and better use of the ash tree as a sustainable resource and reveals some of the dire threats to our ash trees. The emerald ash borer, a voracious and destructive beetle, has killed tens of millions of ash trees across North America since 2002. Unless we are prepared to act now and better value our trees, Penn argues, the ash tree and its many magnificent contributions to mankind will become a thing of the past. This exuberant tale of nature, human ingenuity, and the pleasure of making things by hand chronicles how the urge to understand and appreciate trees still runs through us all like grain through wood.</p></p><p>Robert Penn is the author of the best-selling celebration of craftsmanship, It&#x2019;s All About the Bike. A writer and journalist, Penn wrote and presented Tales from the Wild Wood, a television series about British woodlands. He lives in a wooded valley in South Wales with his family.&#x201c;A beautifully figured and multicolored ode to our love affair with the invaluable ash tree. I swooned. Penn&#x2019;s paean to the many uses of the ash is so well-wrought that I am compelled to take up hurling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nick Offerman</strong><br><br>&#x201c;There is no greater debt than that which mankind owes to trees, and Robert Penn proves this brilliantly&#x2015;a highly readable account of the multitude of uses one single ash tree can provide.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lars Mytting, author of <em>Norwegian Wood</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The appeal of Robert Penn&#x2019;s enchanting narrative extends far beyond tree enthusiasts, woodworkers, and fanatic loggers like me. It is a book-lover&#x2019;s feast. Penn&#x2019;s wonderful prose and compelling research put <em>The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees</em> right up there in the league with such classics as John McPhee&#x2019;s <em>The Survival of the Bark Canoe</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rinker Buck, <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>The Oregon Trail</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Ranges] freely over intellectual territory&#x2015;masculinity, nostalgia, identity. . . . Fascinating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Books of the Year 2015, <em>The Times (UK)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A well-crafted tribute to the ash. . . . Penn has made a lovely book: part elegant history, part anxious lament.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Guardian</em></strong></p><h2>Maximinus Thrax: From Common Soldier to Emperor of Rome</h2><p><b>The first full-length biography of the half-barbarian emperor.</b><br><br>Maximinus was a Thracian tribesman of frightening appearance and colossal size&#x201d; who could smash stones with his bare hands and pull fully laden wagons unaided. Such feats impressed the emperor Severus who enlisted Maximinus into the imperial bodyguard whereupon he embarked on a distinguished military career. Eventually he achieved senior command in the massive Roman invasion of Persia in 232 AD, and three years later he became emperor himself in a military coup the first common soldier ever to assume the imperial throne.<br><br>Supposedly more than seven feet tall (it is likely he had a pituitary disorder), Maximinus was surely one of Rome&#x2019;s most extraordinary emperors. He campaigned across the Rhine and Danube for three years until a rebellion erupted in Africa and the snobbish senate engaged in civil war against him.<br><br>This is a narrative account of the life and times of the Thracian giant, from his humble origins up to and beyond the civil war of 238 AD.

He is also impoverished, with no hope of buying the horse needed to win the Grand National&#x2015;until he meets Charlotte Baird. A clever, plainspoken heiress whose money gives her a choice among suitors, Charlotte falls in love with Bay, the first man to really notice her, for his vulnerability as well as his glamour. When Sisi joins the legendary hunt organized by Earl Spencer in England, Bay is asked to guide her on the treacherous course.

IT WAS AT THE POINT where the women were rosy from the dancing, but before the moment when coiffures began to slip &#x2013; carefully curled fringes flattening in the heat. The guests, who had been delaying their arrival so that it would appear that they had been dining at one of the more fashionable houses before the ball, had finally dared to make their appearance. The parliamentary lobbies on the Suez bill had closed and the ballroom was spotted with MPs and ministers. It was the last event of the season before people disappeared to the country for the summer, so there was an energy to the occasion as the guests tried to make the most of this last opportunity to squeeze what they wanted from the world: a promotion, a liaison, a husband, a mistress, a loan, or simply a piece of delicious gossip. No one wanted to miss this party; it was the final opportunity to acquire the baubles of hope and intrigue that would make the arid summer months bearable before the fashionable world reassembled in the autumn.</p> <p>As Bay Middleton made his way up the double staircase, he saw that Earl Spencer, the Red Earl as he was known, was still standing by the door to welcome his guests. The last time Bay had seen Earl Spencer in evening dress had been in Dublin at the Vice Regal&nbsp;lodge. There he had been the Queen&#x2019;s representative, and with his great height and golden red beard he had looked the part. But now<br>the political wind had changed, the Whigs had been ousted by the Tories under Disraeli, and Spencer looked a little less burnished. His kingdom was on the hunting field, not here under the chandeliers. But he had daughters to bring out and a Party anxious to manoeuvre itself back into power, so there was no help for it. Still, he hovered on the edge of the festivities as if ready to follow more promising sport at any moment.</p> <p>Spencer caught sight of Bay at the bottom of the stairs and called to him before the footman could announce him.</p> <p>&#x2018;Middleton, my dear fellow. I am uncommon glad to see you here.&#x2019; He squeezed Bay&#x2019;s hand in his great freckled paw.</p> <p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s not the same as Dublin, eh?&#x2019; Spencer&#x2019;s pale blue eyes clouded. &#x2018;Still, we have royalty tonight. The Queen of Naples, no less, or should I say the former Queen. Very grand, like all these deposed monarchs, but lively enough.&#x2019; He pointed a stubby finger at Bay. &#x2018;I shall rely on you to entertain her. She speaks perfect English but she has a way of sighing that is altogether foreign. I believe the King is not altogether to her taste. No doubt you could bring a smile to those handsome lips.&#x2019;</p> <p>Bay smiled. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think a queen would have much time for a mere cavalry captain, My Lord. But I am at your service as always.&#x2019;</p> <p>Spencer laughed and put his arm around his shoulders.</p> <p>&#x2018;They were high times in Ireland, eh Middleton? Best hunting in the world. Still, who knows? Disraeli can&#x2019;t last for ever and then we will be back with a vengeance.&#x2019;</p> <p>He propelled Bay into the ballroom where the orchestra was playing a polka.</p> <p>&#x2018;There she is, Queen Maria, the heroine of Gaeta. They say she took command of the garrison and fought against Garibaldi and the Risorgimento while her husband the little king locked himself in his bedroom.&#x2019; Spencer pointed to a tall dark woman dressed in white who stood surrounded by a group of men in uniform. </p> <p>&#x2018;It appears that she is still in command of her troops.&#x2019; Bay thought that the Queen looked as if she was posing for a portrait, her arms positioned in a perfect oval and her head turned slightly so that everyone could admire her clear profile and the long curve of her neck. She wore a small tiara that sparkled against her dark hair. </p> <p>&#x2018;At least she looks the part,&#x2019; said Spencer. &#x2018;Not like the Widow of Windsor. And a horsewoman too. She came out with the Pytchley last year, led the pack all the way. I suppose a day out with the Pytchley is compensation for losing a kingdom, eh?&#x2019; But Bay was no longer looking at the Queen in her frame of courtiers. He had seen Blanche&#x2019;s blond head and he could not help following it as it tacked across the dance floor. Spencer followed his gaze and made a small tutting noise. </p> <p>&#x2018;I believe you are not listening to me, Middleton. Still, I shall leave you to your own pursuits, even if no good can come of them. It&#x2019;s high time you got married. The right sort of wife would make all the difference.&#x2019; The Earl moved off towards the supper room, leaving Bay watching Blanche as she danced around the room. He was dismayed to see how very gracefully she was dancing tonight. She was coming around again and he knew that if she were to turn her head she would see him. He stood there, unable to move, and then just as they were about to come face to face, he saw a flash of white to his left and turned his head. It was Charlotte Baird &#x2013; still small and dun-coloured but just then a most welcome sight. </p> <p>He pulled himself around to face her. She was standing beside her aunt and another lady, whom Bay recognised as Augusta Crewe, Fred&#x2019;s fianc�e. Charlotte looked very small standing beside the other women. Middleton bowed to the group and moved next to her. </p> <p>&#x2018;I hope you can hear the music now, Miss Baird.&#x2019; </p> <p>She nodded. He thought she looked less sure of herself here in the glittering expanse of the ballroom than she had in the enclosed space of the box at Covent Garden. </p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but this music is not intended to be listened to.&#x2019; She smiled her crooked smile and Bay could see that her fingers were tapping her fan. </p> <p>He bowed and asked her to dance. But before Charlotte could answer, Augusta said, &#x2018;Oh, but you are too late, Captain Middleton, Miss Baird&#x2019;s dance card is quite full. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Charlotte?&#x2019; Augusta blinked her sandy eyelashes at Bay. </p> <p>Charlotte laughed. &#x2018;Oh, but Augusta, I must make room for Captain Middleton. Haven&#x2019;t you noticed how magnificent Fred is looking tonight? It is all the work of Captain Middleton here who sent him to his tailor. I think I should express our gratitude, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; </p> <p>Augusta sniffed. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t say that I have noticed anything in particular. Fred is always well turned out.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, you are just being loyal. You may have the next dance, Captain Middleton, and Augusta, perhaps you would make my excuses to Captain Hartopp.&#x2019; </p> <p>The band struck up a waltz. Bay held out his hand to Charlotte. He was surprised at how small and how light she was. She barely came up to his shoulder, unlike Blanche, who had always been on a level with him. She was concentrating too hard on the steps to look at him at first. He could see her biting her lip with effort. He tightened his grip on her waist and finally she raised her eyes to his and said, &#x2018;You are a very good dancer.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;I have had lots of practice. In Ireland there was nothing to do except hunt and go to parties.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;But Captain Hartopp was in Ireland with you, was he not? He doesn&#x2019;t dance as well as you.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay smiled. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s true, no one could call Chicken a dancer. He can ride, though.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Why do you call him Chicken, Captain Middleton? I&#x2019;ve asked Fred but he won&#x2019;t tell me.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;If your brother won&#x2019;t tell you, then you can hardly expect me to, Miss Baird.&#x2019; He saw her frown and continued, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t be cross. It is rather a sad little story and I am too fond of Chicken to repeat it.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;But you don&#x2019;t mind taking his dancing partner away?&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay looked down at her, surprised. He hadn&#x2019;t expected Fred&#x2019;s sister to be so lively. </p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, but that was your decision, not mine. Once you had accepted my invitation I could hardly turn you down.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;How chivalrous you are, Captain Middleton.&#x2019; She looked up at him through her lashes and Bay decided that her eyes were grey, almost the colour of the blue roan he had ridden in Ireland last summer. She was not beautiful but he found he liked looking at her face. </p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I guessed that you didn&#x2019;t want to dance with Chicken all night.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Are you a mind reader then, Captain Middleton, as well as being the best dressed officer in the Guards?&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay laughed. &#x2018;And on what basis do you call me that? Are you an expert in Guards uniforms, Miss Baird?&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Not at all, but my brother is. Fred doesn&#x2019;t praise people very often, so I am inclined to believe him. I am only sorry you are not wearing your uniform tonight so I can see what perfection looks like.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I think there are quite enough uniforms here tonight.&#x2019; Bay&#x2019;s voice was dismissive. He felt there was something ostentatious about wearing uniform to every social occasion. </p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I am sure your tails are the epitome of understated good taste, Captain Middleton.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay could not help but glance at his impeccable tail coat with its four jet buttons on the cuff. Charlotte smiled and he checked himself. &#x2018;You are mocking me, but I am not ashamed of taking the trouble to ensure my clothes fit properly.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;I envy your attention to detail. Fred is always berating me for my lack of interest in clothes. He would like me to be a fashion plate like Augusta. But I find the rigmarole of dressmaking so tedious. Standing perfectly still while people stick pins into you is not my idea of an occupation.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;So what would you rather be doing, Miss Baird?&#x2019; She didn&#x2019;t answer immediately and they did a turn around the dance floor before she said rather hesitantly, &#x2018;I like to take photographs.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay did not conceal his surprise. How could this curious girl be related to stuffy old Fred? &#x2018;Really? What sort of things do you photograph?&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, a variety of things, landscapes, portraits, animals, whatever I think will make a good composition.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Have you ever taken a picture of a horse?&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Not yet. Did you have one in mind?&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;I would like very much to have a likeness of Tipsy, my hunter. She is a thing of beauty.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Horse and rider would be interesting. Have you have ever had your photograph taken, Captain Middleton?&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Never.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Has no one ever asked you for a picture? I am surprised.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay was about to answer when he saw Blanche&#x2019;s golden head and white face inches away from him. He lost his balance for a second and stepped out wildly, then heard a gasp and a faint tearing noise. </p> <p>&#x2018;Miss Baird, I am so sorry, what have I done?&#x2019; Bay looked down and saw that he had put his foot through the flounce of her skirt, leaving a grubby rent in the white silk. </p> <p>He thought for a moment that Charlotte was going to cry but she shook her head and said, &#x2018;It doesn&#x2019;t matter, but I think I should get it sewn up.&#x2019; </p> <p>They retreated to some seats in the corner and Middleton told a footman to fetch a maid with needle and thread. </p> <p>&#x2018;Unless of course you would rather go somewhere more private like the cloakroom.&#x2019; </p> <p>She gave him a sideways look. &#x2018;Oh no, I would much rather stay here and try to figure out why such an excellent dancer should lose his balance.&#x2019; </p> <p>He made a little flourish with his hands. &#x2018;You could make anyone unsteady, Miss Baird.&#x2019; </p> <p>She did not reply for a moment, considering his remark, and then said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think that was the reason, Captain Middleton.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay was about to protest when the maid arrived and started to sew up the gash in her dress. Bay stood in front of Charlotte, shielding her from the room. When the girl had finished and the dress was whole again he said, &#x2018;I daresay you won&#x2019;t dance with me again, but can I take you into supper?&#x2019; </p> <p>Charlotte shook her head. &#x2018;I am promised to Captain Hartopp. I can&#x2019;t abandon him again.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;How very irritating. Let me, at least, take you back to Lady Lisle.&#x2019; </p> <p>He put out his arm, but she hesitated and then took a flower from the corsage at her wrist. It was a small white rosebud whose tightly furled petals were tinged with pink. </p> <p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ve lost your buttonhole, Captain Middleton. Won&#x2019;t you take this instead?&#x2019; </p> <p>He picked up the flower from her outstretched palm and put it into his lapel. It was smaller than the gardenia and there was no scent that he could detect. </p> <p>&#x2018;You are very kind, Miss Baird.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Hardly that. It&#x2019;s just that I notice things.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Even without a camera?&#x2019; </p> <p>She smiled. &#x2018;Once you learn to look at things properly, you never stop.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Now I feel thoroughly nervous of having my likeness taken.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;But I only see what is there, Captain Middleton.&#x2019; </p> <p>He was about to ask what she saw, but noticed Chicken Hartopp making towards them across the dance floor. </p> <p>&#x2018;There you are, Miss Baird. I have come to rescue you from Middleton. I hope you haven&#x2019;t forgotten that you promised to let me take you into supper.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Of course not, Captain Hartopp. I was just on my way.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;My fault entirely, Chicken. Miss Baird here was furnishing me with a new buttonhole.&#x2019; </p> <p>Hartopp looked at the white rosebud on Bay&#x2019;s lapel and flushed. Bay realised that somehow he had offended him. Charlotte looked embarrassed and put her hand on Hartopp&#x2019;s arm. </p> <p>&#x2018;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind. Captain Middleton needed a new buttonhole and there are so many flowers in the beautiful corsage you gave me that I could spare one . . .&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Of course I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x2019; said Hartopp, who clearly did. &#x2018;We should get to the supper room before the ices are all gone.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay knew that it was ignoble of him to enjoy Hartopp&#x2019;s annoyance, but he could not help himself. Hartopp and Fred Baird had never concealed their amazement that despite Middleton&#x2019;s inferior social position and fortune, he was not only a better rider than either of them but was also much more popular with women. </p> <p>But satisfying though Chicken&#x2019;s chagrin had been, Bay took even more pleasure in the fact that little Charlotte Baird had had no qualms about giving him the flower. She liked him, and though Bay was used to being liked by women, he was pleased that this particular girl had decided to favour him. She was not a girl, he guessed, who was easily pleased. </p> <p>The band started playing a tune that Bay recognised as one that he had danced to with Blanche. They had not danced together very often, as Blanche was careful of her public reputation, so Bay was able to remember each dance quite distinctly. This particular polka had been playing the night of the Londonderry Ball. They had just become lovers and there had been something intoxicating about being able to hold her in his arms in public. She had hardly looked at him, but he had seen the pulse beating in her neck. He found himself looking across the ballroom for her, wondering if she too remembered that other night, but there was no blond head among the swirling dancers. She must be at supper or perhaps she had gone home. Bay was surprised that she could have left without his noticing. He looked at his pocket watch; it was almost midnight. It was much later than he thought. He had been distracted. </p> <p>There was a cough behind him. He turned to see a man wearing a dress uniform he didn&#x2019;t recognise. </p> <p>&#x2018;Captain Middleton?&#x2019; The man spoke with an accent, French or Italian. </p> <p>Bay nodded. </p> <p>&#x2018;My name is Count Cagliari. I am equerry to her Majesty, the Queen of Naples.&#x2019; Cagliari looked over to where the Queen was sitting. Bay bowed. Cagliari was tall and blond, his chest extensively be-medalled. </p> <p>&#x2018;At your service.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;I believe you may know that Her Majesty will be hunting with the Pytchley this winter.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay nodded. &#x2018;I hear that she is an excellent horsewoman.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, that is the case. Her Majesty is quite without fear. But she is a queen and there is a feeling that she should have some assistance. She is after all riding with the public.&#x2019; </p> <p>Bay smiled. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think the members of the Pytchle...</p></p><h2>Praise Works</h2><p>What often seems to be a tragedy is for our own good, and if we can praise God no matter what, it can turn out to be the most wonderful blessing in the world.</p><p>Merlin R.

The authors lay out the dual contexts in which church leaders must function&#x2013;within the congregation, and as the congregation&#x2019;s representative to the community&#x2013;and they explain the very different skill sets required to flourish in each. Underlying the revised edition is an insistence on the congregational leader&#x2019;s call from God, and cultivation of her or his relationship with God. Leadership is not the same thing as charisma, they explain; it is rather a set of attitudes and practices that each of us can and must master if we are to be worthy servants of Christ.</p> <p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>"Heuser and Shawchuck have done an outstanding revision of their classic volume, <i>Leading the Congregation</i>.

After all, her last trip with Miss Lernin involved real-life dinosaurs! So, when they end up at the aquarium's jellyfish exhibit, Ronnie is confused. Surely jellyfish aren&#x2019;t as cool as dinosaurs, right? Wrong! Determined to show Ronnie just how interesting prehistoric life was <i>before</i> the age of the dinosaurs, Miss Lernin takes her back in time to the six parts of the Paleozoic era to study the earliest lifeforms on Earth, and how many left the ocean for life on land.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Abby Howard</b> is the creator of the comic website Junior Scientist Power Hour.

Detailed illustrations of the microscopic flora and fauna of ancient sea floors allow for careful examination of the strange and wondrous creatures along the long chain of evolution. Young fans of informational books will appreciate the many facts, pronunciation keys, and diagrams that fill Howard's accessible narrative, as we follow the protagonist Ronnie and her teacher and caretaker, Miss Lernin, on their adventure.

Are you convinced that traffic lights always turn red for you? Do you have to win (so as not to lose)? After extricating yourself from a bad relationship, do you find another partner just like the previous one? If so, congratulations! You have the makings of an unhappiness expert. With the techniques in this book, you can raise yourself to the genius level. A word of warning, however. Along the way you may begin to ask yourself, "How did I manage to turn myself into my own worst enemy?" Fortunately, this tongue-in-cheek (but serious) volume takes a look at that question too.<br><br> Special attention is given to such topics as "Four Games with the Past," "Self-fulfilling Prophecies," and "Why Would Anybody Love Me?" Those who believe that the search for happiness will eventually lead to happiness will find much to ponder in the section "Beware of Arriving."<br><br> All readers will be both amused and startled to find themselves in these pages, but there is a special delight and enlightenment for therapists and counselors. Although the author does not officially admit it, the book is one complex "symptom prescription," a therapeutic <em>double bind</em> as described and practiced by him and his colleagues.</p><p>Paul Watzlawick was an associate at the Mental Research Institute, Palo Alto, and clinical professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Stanford University Medical Center.

She passed away in December 2017.I never hear the word "Nevada" without thinking of Robert Dietz. This coming May, we would celebrate our sixth anniversary of barely ever seeing each other. Truly, in the time I'd known him, I don't think we'd been together two months at a stretch, and that was only once. But now I needed his Nevada smarts and I dialed his number in Carson City. Three rings and his machine picked up. I listened to his message, which was terse and to the point. I waited for the beep and said, "Hey, Dietz. This is Kinsey. I need a favor from you. I'm looking for a woman named Susan Telford in Henderson, Nevada, and I wondered if you'd see what you can find out. There are thirty-three Telfords listed, and it doesn't make sense for me to tackle the job from Santa Teresa. Pete Wolinsky put her name on a list of six women who are all connected in one way or another to a man named Ned Lowe. Before Pete was killed, he went to some lengths to do background on Lowe, who seems like an all-around bad egg. If you have questions, call me back, and if you don't want to do the job, that's fine. Just let me know."<br><br> I decided it was time to convert my investigation into report form. I was formulating a sense of the relationship between Ned Lowe and the six women whose names appeared on Pete's list, but so far the link existed only in my head.<br><br> I'd inserted paper into my typewriter when the phone rang. "Millhone Investigations."<br><br> A gentleman with a powdery voice said, "Miss Millhone, this is Stanley Munce, formerly with the Burning Oaks Police Department. Clara Doyle told me you'd spoken to her about a case I worked on some years ago. Is that correct?"<br><br> "Yes, sir. Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling. I was asking about Lenore Redfern Lowe."<br><br> "That was my understanding. I'm afraid I don't have much to offer on the subject, but I will tell you what I can. I was the coroner's investigator at the time of that young girl's death. In order to complete a death certificate, the coroner has to determine the cause, mechanism, and manner of death.<br><br> "Simply put, cause of death is the reason the individual died, as would be the case with a heart attack or gunshot wound. The mechanism of death would be the actual changes that affect the victim's physiology, resulting in death. In death from a fatal stabbing, for instance, it might be extreme blood loss.<br><br> "The manner of death is how the death came about. Five of the six possibilities are natural, accidental, suicide, homicide, and undetermined. The sixth classification would be 'pending' if the matter's still under investigation, which is obviously not the case here. There was no question about her ingestion of Valium and alcohol. The generic diazepam is a central nervous system depressant, the effects of which can be intensified by alcohol. However, when the toxicology report came in, it appeared there wasn't a sufficient quantity of either to say with certainty death resulted from the combination of the two.<br><br> "What seemed questionable, at least in my mind, was the presence of petechiae, which are tiny broken blood vessels, like pinpricks, visible in the area of her eyes. Hard coughing or crying are common causes; sometimes the strain of childbirth or lifting weights. Petechiae can also be a sign of death by asphyxiation."<br><br> "You mean she might have been suffocated?"<br><br> "Smothered, yes. There were no fractures of the larynx, hyoid bone, thyroid or cricoid cartilages, and no areas of bruising, which ruled out manual strangulation. Mrs. Lowe had been under doctor's care. With her history of mental problems, absent any other compelling evidence, Dr. Wilkinson&#x2014;the coroner&#x2014;felt a finding of suicide was appropriate. I put up what objections I could, but I have no formal medical training, and his experience and expertise prevailed. For my part, I was never fully persuaded."<br><br> "So there was never an investigation into the circumstances of her death?"<br><br> "A cursory assessment, I'd say. Dr. Wilkinson was of the old school: high-handed and a bit of an autocrat. He was in charge, he made the judgment call, and he brooked no argument. I was putting my job at risk even to raise the few questions I did.<br><br> "I wish I could offer you more. It's bothered me for years but yours is the first question ever raised about that girl."<br><br> Which was not quite the case, but Stanley Munce couldn't know that. There had been another question raised in the matter, and that was Pete's.<br><br> I'd barely hung up when the phone rang again.<br><br> It was Dietz. He skipped right over the greetings and the chitchat. "What have you gotten yourself into?"<br><br> I felt like someone had thrown a bucket of water in my face. "You obviously know more than I do, so you tell me."<br><br> "I can tell you who Susan Telford is. Everybody in this part of the state knows who she is. She's a fourteen-year-old white female who disappeared two years ago."<br><br> I felt myself go still. "What happened to her?"<br><br> "She vanished. She might as well have gone up in smoke. The cops talked to everyone including vagrants and registered sex offenders."<br><br> "Nobody saw anything?"<br><br> "Eventually her best friend spoke up. She was too damn scared at first, but she finally broke down and told her mother some guy approached Susan in the mall a couple of days before she disappeared. He was snapping Polaroids. He said he worked for a fashion magazine and asked if she's be interested in some freelance modeling&#x2014;"<br><br> "Dietz."<br><br> "That was all crap, of course. The guy was obviously cruising for young girls and she was gullible enough to&#x2014;"<br><br> "Dietz. I've heard this story, only in the version I was told, her name was Janet Macy and she lived in Tucson. I talked to her mother on the phone a week ago. She last saw her daughter in 1986. She thinks Janet went off to New York to launch her modeling career. Some photographer claimed he worked in the fashion industry and thought she showed promise. He was going to help her put together a portfolio. Not even sixteen and she went off with him like a damn fool."<br><br> "Shit."<br><br> "Her mother did file a missing person report, but the officer didn't think she had anything to worry about. All this time she's been telling herself stories about where the girl was and why she didn't write.<br><br> "Dietz. This is Ned Lowe. I know it.

A mysterious disease is causing ordinary people to commit brutal murders--even of family and friends. CIA Agent Drew Phillips is trying to get his hands on a live victim for epidemiologists. As narrator, Sigler seems unenthusiastic about his own story--he offers a swift reading, complete with a cheesy score. Sigler's vocal characterizations do not often vary from the matter-of fact tone he uses for the narrative. Though there are a few creative techniques at work--for example, dialogue is delivered through a fuzzy speaker to represent telephone conversations--the final result is mediocre.

Born into a prominent family of pious scholars and Sufi devotees, 'A'ishah received a thorough religious education and memorized the Quran at age eight. A mystic and a prolific poet and writer, she composed more works in Arabic than any other woman before the 20th century. Yet despite her extraordinary literary and religious achievements, 'A'ishah al-Ba'uniyyah remains largely unknown. For the first time, her key work, The Principles of Sufism, is available in English translation.</p><p> The Principles of Sufism is a mystical guide book to help others on their spiritual path. Outlining the four principles of Repentance, Sincerity, Remembrance, and Love, it traces the fundamental stages and states of the spiritual novice&#x2019;s transformative journey, emphasizing the importance of embracing both human limitations and God&#x2019;s limitless love. Drawing on lessons and readings from centuries-old Sufi tradition, 'A'ishah advises the seeker to repent of selfishness and turn to a sincere life of love. In addition to his lucid translation, Th. Emil Homerin provides an insightful introduction, notes and a glossary to 'A'ishah al-Ba'uniyyah&#x2019;s remarkable account of the pursuit of mystical illumination.</p></p><p><p><b>'A'ishah al-Ba'uniyyah</b> (d. 923 H/1517 AD) of Damascus was one of the great women scholars in Islamic history.

Homerin's elegant and readable translation is made especially valuable by the side-by-side presentation of the Arabic and English texts.

He knew it by the obvious signs, of course, but he also felt it in his gut. What he didn&#x2019;t know was how many there were and when they would make their move. He&#x2019;d already picked up the package right under their noses, so they certainly weren&#x2019;t going to let him reach the drop-off. But how close would they let him get?</p><p>He stopped before the window of a watch shop and stood admiring the newest Tissots on display. From the corner of his eye, he saw the man he&#x2019;d named Tail 6.1 (one watcher on his six o&#x2019;clock position) also stop before a window to study the merchandise. The man was good; as Fisher watched, the man pulled out his cell phone, dialed, then said after a moment, &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m looking at it right now . . . yeah, the exact one you&#x2019;ve been looking for . . .&#x201d;</p><p><i>A good tail personalizes his or her cover,</i> Fisher reminded himself. Without that, a watcher tends to carry a &#x201c;pursuit aura&#x201d; that anyone with even the most rudimentary countersurveillance training would pick up on.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . no, the one on Franklin Street . . . right. Okay, bye.&#x201d;</p><p>Walking fifty feet behind Tail 6.1, Tail 6.2.2 (two watchers together, a man and woman walking arm in arm, second position behind the first tail), passed their compatriot at the shop window and kept walking, passing Fisher a few seconds later and continuing down the sidewalk. Fisher mentally switched their designation to Tail 12.2&#x2014;they were now in the lead tail position.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been keeping this imaginary clock face in his head for the past two hours, moving the various pawns around as they changed positions and proximity to him. They were all very good, moving seamlessly as they kept a blanket of surveillance over him, all the while changing clothes and partners and demeanors in hopes of remaining invisible to him. It hadn&#x2019;t worked, but neither had he been able to lose them with the routine dry-cleaning tactics. The other factor: Did they know he&#x2019;d made them? Probably not; if they did, they would&#x2019;ve already taken him.</p><p>It would have been ridiculous&#x2014;all these do-they-know-I-know machinations&#x2014;if it hadn&#x2019;t been so deadly serious. They&#x2019;d already come close to catching him in the act two weeks earlier; if it happened this time, he was done.</p><p>Fisher checked his watch. Another ten minutes was all he needed.</p><p>Ten minutes and one last attempt to lose them.</p><p>He turned from the shop window and continued down the sidewalk, but at a slower pace, letting the couple ahead of him gain some distance. The sidewalk and streets were moist with fog from the bay, and the mist swirled around the streetlights, rainbow-hued halos that seemed to shift and pulse as Fisher&#x2019;s path took him closer or farther from each one. In the distance he could hear the mournful gong of navigation buoys.</p><p>Ahead he could see the entrance to the alley, a darkened rectangle between two buildings. He&#x2019;d chosen it the night before for a number of reasons: It sat equidistant between two streetlamps; its end was blocked by a tall hurricane fence topped with barbed wire; and, if he timed it correctly, his lead tails would round the corner ahead before he reached the alley entrance. And, once inside, to keep him in sight, one or more of the watchers would have to follow him in&#x2014;probably the lone man on his tail. <i>So, ten seconds for him to reach the entrance, thirty more waiting to see if his target reemerged</i>, Fisher thought. With luck, he&#x2019;d have forty seconds to do what he needed to do.</p><p>Keeping his eyes fixed on the couple ahead and his ears tuned to the click of heels on the sidewalk behind him, Fisher adjusted his pace, waiting, waiting . . . The couple ahead rounded the corner. Fisher drew even with the alley&#x2019;s entrance and continued for three more paces, then abruptly wheeled left and strode into the shadowed alley. Feeling the darkness envelop him, Fisher felt a wave of relief. For most of his career, he&#x2019;d worked strictly in the shadows, and he&#x2019;d come to think of them as his closest ally. Conversely, this cloak-and-dagger business was done mostly in plain sight. It was a different kind of game altogether. It had taken some getting used to.</p><p>On flat feet he sprinted halfway down the alley until he reached the darkened doorway to his left, then ducked into it. Just as he&#x2019;d left it, the tin garbage can lid was propped against the brick wall.

RJ Wheaton offers an impressionistic investigation of <i>Dummy </i>that imitates the cumulative structure of the album itself, piecing together interviews, impressions of time and place, cultural criticism, and a thorough exploration of the music itself. </p><p>The approach focuses as much on the reception and response that <i>Dummy </i>engendered as it does on the original production of the album. How is that so many people have, collectively, made a quintessential headphone album into a nightclub album? How have they made the product of a niche local scene into an international success? This is the story of how an innovative, experimental album became the iconic sound for the better part of a decade; and an aesthetic template for the experience of music in the digital age.</p></p><p><b>RJ Wheaton</b>'s writing on music, film, and literature has been published in The Oxford American, DaCapo's Best Music Writing series, and at PopMatters.com, where he is Senior Producer.

Besides the countless spontaneous prayers found throughout her autobiography, letters, poetry, and plays, St. Th�r�se left behind 21 additional independent prayers, from every period of her life, here collected for the first time. In this book we find prayers to the Infant Jesus and the Holy Face, prayers to Mary and the saints, prayers composed in joy and sorrow, prayers written for her novices and missionary brothers. All of them reflect the Saint's passionate love of God, which she wished to share with friends near and far. The highlight of this volume is the first critical text of Th�r�se's famous Offering to Merciful Love, fully annotated. Ample background materials explain the setting and significance of each prayer. Scholars will find here essential new information for the study of the Saint's doctrine; general readers will find this book an indispensible resource for learning to pray as Th�r�se did. It is prayer, it is sacrifice which give me all my strength; these are the invincible weapons Jesus has given me. They can touch souls much better than words.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Alphabet in the Park: Selected Poems (Wesleyan Poetry in Translation)</h2><p>This is the first book published in English by of the work of Brazilian poet Ad�lia Prado. Incorporating poems published over the past fifteen years, The Alphabet in the Park is a book of passion and intelligence, wit and instinct. These are poems about human concerns, especially those of women, about living in one's body and out of it, about the physical but also the spiritual and the imaginative life. Prado also writes about ordinary matters; she insists that the human experience is both mystical and carnal. To Prado these are not contradictory: "It's the soul that's erotic," she writes.<br><br>As Ellen Watson says in her introduction, "Ad�lia Prados poetry is a poetry of abundance. These poems overflow with the humble, grand, various stuff of daily life &#x2013;; necklaces, bicycles, fish; saints and prostitutes and presidents; innumerable chickens and musical instruments...And, seemingly at every turn, there is food." But also, an abundance of dark things, cancer, death, greed. These are poems of appetite, all kinds.</p><p>6 x 9 trim.

Clare Cosi, the head barista at Village Blend; Blend owner Madame Dreyfus Allegro Dubois (who's Clare's ex-mother-in-law); and Blend employee Dante Silva narrowly escape death in the bomb-activated blaze that destroys Enzo Testa's Caffe Lucia in Queens and seriously injures Enzo. Clare informs the irritating, overly flirtatious FDNY captain, Michael Quinn, a cousin of her NYPD detective boyfriend, Mike Quinn, that she suspects arson. As fire marshal Stuart Rossi swings into action, Clare is eager to help catch the firebug (aka the Coffee Shop Arsonist), but Rossi is less than enthusiastic about her getting involved. Later, the arsonist torches a Long Island coffeehouse, killing a firefighter, as a warning. While the media worry that a terrorist is loose, new, even more horrible crimes surface.

Actually make that <i>two</i> cases. First a gorgeous Faberg� egg has been stolen. Who would have the heart to snatch such a precious family heirloom from someone new to town? Some housewarming <i>that</i> is! <br> And if this isn't enough to keep me busy, someone's running through gardens and stomping on all the zucchinis. Needless to say, it's a big mess -- in more ways than one. Especially for Mr. Safer, who is suspected of squishing the squash. I'm pretty sure Mr. Safer's innocent. But who's the real vegetable vandal?</p><p>Eggs and zucchini may sound like a special Sunday omelet to most, but for Nancy Drew, it means it's time to roll up her sleeves and start solving mysteries. In this first book of the "modernized" series featuring the whip-smart girl detective, Nancy is called upon to solve not one but two whodunits, simultaneously. Someone has been smashing the neighborhood zucchini patches and the disgruntled gardeners are starting to point fingers at one another. Meanwhile, a new resident in Nancy's Midwestern town is frantic when she discovers that her old and precious Faberge egg has been stolen. Can our favorite not-so-hard-boiled detective unscramble both these cases before it's too late? <p> Fans of Carolyn Keene's classic Nancy Drew series will be pleased to note that, although Nancy has been brought up to date with computers and cell phones, she's still the same sweet girl who volunteers in her spare time. All her old buddies are alive and well: George is still a tomboy, but now spends her time surfing the Web; Bess continues to be a bit of a femme fatale, but only in the nicest way; Nancy's boyfriend Ned remains ever faithful and ever patient; and housekeeper Hannah Gruen is as gruffly, bustlingly loving as always.

Ayers&#39;s English Words from Latin and Greek Elements</h2><p><b>For more than forty years</b>, <i>English Words from Latin and Greek Elements</i>, by Donald M. Ayers, has shown thousands of students the way to a broader vocabulary by teaching them to recognize the classical roots found in many English words. When the second edition of that text appeared in 1986, it was joined by a workbook that has proven exceptionally popular in reinforcing those vocabulary skills. Each lesson in the Workbook complements the text with a variety of exercises: short-answer, matching, multiple choice, word analysis, fill-in-the-blank, and true-false.<br><br> The Workbook has now been revised to make it more relevant and useful. It features a new dictionary exercise and word analysis exercises, the replacement of true-false exercises that have caused the most difficulty for students, and the elimination of archaic words and other items that have become dated. The authors have also improved the clarity of the instructions for individual exercises, in some cases adding notes or providing sample answers. As part of the revised front matter, there is a new introduction written just for students to help them get the most out of the workbook. <i>English Words </i>and the <i>Workbook</i> have met with unqualified success in English and Classics courses at both the advanced secondary and college levels.

Crime films raise controversial issues about the distribution of social power and the meanings of deviance, and they provide a safe space for fantasies of rebellion, punishment, and the restoration of order.<br> <br>In the first comprehensive study of its kind, well-known criminologist Nicole Rafter examines the relationship between society and crime films from the perspectives of criminal justice, film history and technique, and sociology. <em>Shots in the Mirror</em> begins with an overview of the history of crime films and the emergence of various genres, surveying important films from the silent era, the early gangster films of the '30s, classic film noir, the work of Hitchcock, and recent innovations by Scorsese, Tarrentino, and the Coen brothers.<br> <br>Keeping pace with the evolution of crime films, <em>Shots in the Mirror</em> has been updated to respond to recent developments, trends, and shifting circumstances in the genre. This new edition expands the scope and increases the depth and variety of the previous edition by including foreign films in addition to American movies. Rafter also integrates an entirely new body of literature into the study, reflecting the rapid expansion of scholarship on law-related films over the past three years. She has added a chapter on psycho movies, a previously unrecognized subcategory of crime films. Another new chapter, "The Alternative Tradition and Films of Moral Ambiguity," focuses on recent sex crime films. This new final chapter grows organically out of the first edition's distinction between traditional crime films, with their easy solutions to social problems, and those more unusual critical films which belong to the bleaker, morally ambiguous, alternative tradition.<br> <br> Rafter examines more than three hundred films in this study, considering what they have to say, socially and ideologically, about the causes of crime, and adding valuable contributions to the on-going debate on whether media representations of violence cause crime. <em>Shots in the Mirror</em> is both a marvelous history of crime films and a trenchant analysis of their complex relationship to larger society.<br></p><p><br>Nicole Rafter, Professor Emeritus, School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Northeastern University<br>"It's hard to imagine a more entertaining, well researched, and insightful encyclopedia of English-language crime films. Anyone who wants to know the history and place of crime cinema in the US should start here. Criminologist Rafter combines formidable analytic skills with a genuine love of the<br>movies. Her well supported arguments help us to see many of them in new ways. Each chapter made me want to run out and look at films she discusses; but I didn't want to set the book down until I had finished it."--Neil King, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University<br>"Shots in the Mirror is a book for scholars as well as for buffs by one who is clearly both. It is also a necessary book for students of crime and society as well as for students of film. In this new edition Rafter goes even more pointedly to the question of how crime movies mirror' our world, <br>reflecting the blank, the ambiguous and the unfinished, as well as the heroic and the villainous. I expect to use this book in my teaching, but mainly to devour it for my own pleasure and education."--Richard Sparks, The University of Edinburgh<br>Praise for the previous edition: <br>"No serious studies have been conducted of how on-screen crime influences our perception of real-world crime. It is an ambitious topic, and [Rafter] handles it well in a very brief volume.... [She] concludes with a very interesting exploration of future social problems and how they may be played out<br>on screen.... Food for thought on a very clever topic."--Library Journal<br>"Brims with variety--this may be the only film book that cites the protagonist of Falling Down, The Last Seduction, and The Godfather in one sentence."--KirkusReviews<br>"Provides a brief survey that manages to range wider than other literature in the canon.... [Rafter's] strategy works well to fill a gap in the literature of 'criminological issues raised by movies.'"--Choice<br>"This book can help sociologists who want to know more about crime stories... A terrific resource book for crime movies as documents... The brief comparative accounts of scenarios and character portrayals provide a kind of cultural map about the language of justice, discourses of fear, and the<br>significance of the criminal-as-other. Let us find ways to use such a fine resource to enliven our courses and research, to find ways to tell the right stories."--Contemporary Sociology<br>"One of my favorite chapters (chapter 2) is the examination of the way in which criminologists drop discredited theories over time, but movies "recycle them" because they resonate with audience expectations that are measured by box office receipts."--Contemporary Sociology<br> "It's hard to imagine a more entertaining, well researched, and insightful encyclopedia of English-language crime films.

This simple claim provides the basis for Kathryn Tanner&#39;s powerful study of the centrality of Jesus Christ for all Christian thought and life: if the divine and the human are united in Christ, then Jesus can be seen as key to the pattern that organizes the whole, even while God&#39;s ways remain beyond our grasp. Drawing on the history of Christian thought to develop an innovative Christ-centered theology, this book sheds fresh light on major theological issues such as the imago dei, the relationship between nature and grace, the Trinity&#39;s implications for human community, and the Spirit&#39;s manner of working in human lives. Originally delivered as Warfield Lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary, it offers a creative and compelling contribution to contemporary theology.</p><p>Drawing on the history of Christian thought to develop an innovative Christ-centered theology, Christ the Key sheds fresh light on major theological issues such as the imago dei, the relationship between nature and grace, the Trinity&#39;s implications for human community, and the Spirit&#39;s manner of working in human lives.Kathryn Tanner is Dorothy Grant Maclear Professor of Theology at the University of Chicago Divinity School.

An essential reference work, this definitive book provides authoritative, non-denominational commentary written by an international team of more than 70 leading scholars from various religious backgrounds. Incorporating the latest research, the contributors examine the books of the Bible in exhaustive detail, taking a historical-critical approach that attempts to shed light on the scriptures by placing them in the context in which their first audiences would have encountered them, asking how they came to be composed and what were the purposes of their authors. The <em>Commentary</em> includes a general introduction, extensive introductions to both testaments and the Apocrypha, and briefer introductions to the particular books, plus an essay with commentary on important post-biblical Jewish and Christian literature. Each article concludes with a bibliography that points the reader toward the most important supplemental works in English, including major reference works, introductions, and so forth.<br><br>A truly stunning work of biblical scholarship, <em>The Oxford Bible Commentary</em> will be an invaluable resource for pastors preparing a sermon, for students, for those in study or discussion groups, and indeed for anyone--whether Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox Christian--who seeks a clearer perspective on a text that has been held in reverence for thousands of years. The <em>OBC</em> features a Logos Library System CD-ROM that, once unlocked, gives the reader access to its text and that of the New Revised Standard Version Bible. The CD is fully compatible with all Logos products.<br></p><p>The Bible stands in a category of its own among the world's literature. How you view the Bible, however, depends on what spectacles you are wearing. Like statistics, the Bible can be used to prove almost anything. As a result Bible commentaries are notorious for giving the author's particular angle on the Bible as if it is the only viewpoint. In the case of <i>The Oxford Bible Commentary</i> the angle is "objectively academic." John Muddiman and John Barton are the pair of Oxford dons who have put together the latest weighty book of Biblical scholarship. Happily, they are aware of the limitations of academic comment and don't pretend the book is more than it is. Contributing scholars are mostly British and American and most of them come from a mainstream Protestant background. The articles are therefore polished, precise, and professionally pedantic. No one can fault the meticulous scholarship and wealth of detailed content. That's just what you want from a hefty Bible commentary. On the other hand, what struck me from dipping into this tome is how slippery Biblical scholarship has become. At the turn of the last century Biblical criticism shot fundamentalism full of holes, but the new generation of scholars have now shot the certainties of old fashioned Biblical criticism full of holes. As a result the articles exhibit an odd mix of solid content with honest supposition, guesswork, and shoulder shrugging. This actually makes the book better. It's refreshing to read academics who admit their uncertainties. Their honesty allows some questions to remain open-ended, and that's exciting for any serious Biblical student. <i>--Dwight Longenecker, Amazon.co.uk</i><br><strong>John Barton</strong> is Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford. <strong>John Muddiman</strong> is G.

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics is the continuation of Newton's classical physics into new formalisms, each highlighting novel aspects of mechanics that gradually build in complexity to form the basis for almost all of theoretical physics. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics also acts as a gateway to more abstract concepts routed in differential geometry and field theories and can be used to introduce these subject areas to newcomers.<br><br>Journeying in a self-contained manner from the very basics, through the fundamentals and onwards to the cutting edge of the subject, along the way the reader is supported by all the necessary background mathematics, fully worked examples, thoughtful and vibrant illustrations as well as an informal narrative and numerous fresh, modern and inter-disciplinary applications.<br><br>The book contains some unusual topics for a classical mechanics textbook. Most notable examples include the 'classical wavefunction', Koopman-von Neumann theory, classical density functional theories, the 'vakonomic' variational principle for non-holonomic constraints, the Gibbs-Appell equations, classical path integrals, Nambu brackets and the full framing of mechanics in the language of differential geometry.<br></p><p><br>Peter Mann, <em>St Andrews University, UK</em><br><br>Peter Mann completed his undergraduate degree in Chemistry at the University of St Andrews.

At the time, like much of the thinking today and the foundation of modern natural science, the predominant theories held that individual knowledge is limited to thinking that reflects objective, sensory perception. Steiner&#x2019;s view was eventually distilled in his <i>Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts</i> in 1924: <br><br><i>There are those who believe that, with the limits of knowledge derived from sensory perception, the limits of all insight are given. Yet if they would carefully observe how they become conscious of these limits, they would find in the very consciousness of the limits the faculties to transcend them. </i><br><br>In this concise volume, Steiner lays out his argument for this view and, moreover, begins his explication of how one goes beyond thinking to the observation of thinking itself. <br><br> <i>Goethe&#x2019;s Theory of Knowledge</i> is essential reading for a deeper understanding of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s seminal work, <i>Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path: A Philosophy of Freedom</i>. <br><br><b>CONTENTS:</b> <br><ul> <li> <b>Introduction</b> by Christopher Bamford </li> <li> <b>Preface to the Edition of 1924</b> by Rudolf Steiner </li> <li> <b>Foreword to the First Edition (1886)</b> by Rudolf Steiner </li> <li> <b>A.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>The African Memory of Mark: Reassessing Early Church Tradition (Early African Christianity Set)</h2><p>We often regard the author of the Gospel of Mark as an obscure figure about whom we know little. Many would be surprised to learn how much fuller a picture of Mark exists within widespread African tradition, tradition that holds that Mark himself was from North Africa, that he founded the church in Alexandria, that he was an eyewitness to the Last Supper and Pentecost, that he was related not only to Barnabas but to Peter as well and accompanied him on many of his travels. In this provocative reassessment of early church tradition, Thomas C. Oden begins with the palette of New Testament evidence and adds to it the range of colors from traditional African sources, including synaxaries (compilations of short biographies of saints to be read on feast days), archaeological sites, non-Western historical documents and ancient churches. The result is a fresh and illuminating portrait of Mark, one that is deeply rooted in African memory and seldom viewed appreciatively in the West.</p><p><strong>Thomas C. Oden</strong> (Ph.D., Yale University), formerly Henry Anson Buttz Professor of Theology at The Theological School of Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, is now director of the Center for Early African Christianity at Eastern University, St. Davids, Pennsylvania. He is the general editor of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, Ancient Christian Texts and the Ancient Christian Doctrine series as well as the author of <em>Classic Christianity,</em> a revision of his three-volume systematic theology."I trust that this book by Thomas Oden will remind believers that their African spiritual ancestors include Abraham, Jesus, Mark, and thousands of others. Rejoice, believers from the continent of Africa, that you have a spiritual history that dates back to creation. I trust this book will stimulate African scholars to continue research into the African memory of Mark." (James Plueddemann, Trinity Journal, Spring 2014)<br><br>"[T]his reader is grateful to Oden for retelling the theologically profound African story of Mark and opening scholars to a neglected aspect of the reception history of the Gospel of Mark." (Michael Kok, Relegere, Vol. 2, No. 1 (2012))<br><br>"Oden has stumbled upon a fascinating African church tradition and has presented it in an accessible way. . . . It desires to stir a passion within the reader to expore African Christianity more and to read further." (Christopher A. Beetham, Themelios 37.1)<br><br>"Anyone who enjoys learning about narratives of redemptive history across the globe will benefit from it." (Matthew M. Whitehead, Bible Study Magazine, September October 2011)<br><br>"A fresh and unusual perspective on early Church history, this text will surely interest both believers and church historians alike." (Publishers Weekly, July 11, 2011)<br><br>"<em>The African Memory of Mark</em> honors the way the Coptic Church has been the faithful, preeminent carrier of the Markan tradition in the church, and does that by weaving the different genres of sources into a narrative whole. Oden is not unaware of standard depictions of Mark and the Gospel that bears his name in which the African note is rather marginal&#x2015;where it is acknowledged at all&#x2015;but he challenges established scholarship by marshaling the evidence and refocusing it on the continuity of the Coptic memory of Mark. Whether or not the reader agrees with the argument of the book, Oden has raised the bar of scrutiny and challenged many of the unstated assumptions of conventional scholarship. From critic and fan alike, Oden deserves credit." (Lamin Sanneh, D. Willis James Professor of Missions World Christianity, Yale University)<br><br>"<em>The African Memory of Mark</em> is a timely reassessment of Mark, Gospel writer and propagator of the message of Christ to Africa. It rehabilitates a neglected tradition and deserves serious consideration by everyone who has been influenced by the historicist understanding of Mark's life and work." (Tite Ti�nou, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"Oden has organized a fascinating collection of traditions on Mark. For any reader interested in the history of the evangelization of Africa or the life of Mark the Evangelist, this book would be a valuable resource. Oden has made a good case for the African memory of Mark and helped a new generation of Christian ministers and scholars in the Global South to find their place in early Christianity." (Stephen O.

Just for the prestige."<br><br>Chubby<br><br>It's common these days for memoirs of childhood to concentrate on some dark secret within the author's ostensibly happy family. It's not just common; it's pretty much mandatory. Memoir in America is an atrocity arms race. A memoir that reveals incest is trumped by one that reveals bestiality, and that, in turn, is driven from the bestseller list by one that reveals incestuous bestiality.<br><br>When I went into the memoir game, I knew I was working at a horrific disadvantage: As much as I would hate this getting around in literary circles in New York, the fact is that I had a happy childhood. At times, I've imagined how embarrassing this background would be if I found myself discussing childhoods with other memoirists late at night at some memoirist hangout.<br><br>After talking about their own upbringings for a while-the glue- sniffing and sporadically violent grandmother, for instance, or the family tapeworm-they look toward me. Their looks are not totally respectful. They are aware that I've admitted in print that I never heard my parents raise their voices to each other. They have reason to suspect, from bits of information I've let drop from time to time, that I was happy in high school. I try desperately to think of a dark secret in my upbringing. All I can think of is Chubby, the collie dog.<br><br>"Well, there's Chubby, the collie dog," I say, tentatively.<br><br>"Chubby, the collie dog?" they repeat.<br><br>There really was a collie named Chubby. I wouldn't claim that the secret about him qualifies as certifiably traumatic, but maybe it explains an otherwise mysterious loyalty I had as a boy to the collie stories of Albert Payson Terhune. We owned Chubby when I was two or three years old. He was sickly. One day Chubby disappeared. My parents told my sister, Sukey, and me that he had been given to some friends who lived on a farm, so that he could thrive in the healthy country air. Many years later-as I remember, I was home on vacation from college-Chubby's name came up while my parents and Sukey and I were having dinner. I asked why we'd never gone to visit him on the farm. Sukey looked at me as if I had suddenly announced that I was thinking about eating the mashed potatoes with my hands for a while, just for a change of pace.<br><br>"There wasn't any farm," she said. "That was just what they told us. Chubby had to be put to sleep."<br><br>"Put to sleep!" I said. "Chubby's gone?"<br><br>Somebody-my mother, I think-pointed out that Chubby would have been gone in any case, since collies didn't ordinarily live to the age of eighteen.<br><br>"Isn't it sort of late for me to be finding this out?" I said.<br><br>"It's not our fault if you're slow on the uptake," my father said.<br><br>I never found myself in a memoirist gathering that required me to tell the story of Chubby, but, as it happened, I did relate the story in a book. A week or so later, I got a phone call from Sukey.<br><br>"The collie was not called Chubby," she said. "The collie was called George. You were called Chubby."<br><br>1998<br><br>Geography<br><br>Geography was my best subject. You can imagine how I feel when I read that the average American high school student is likely to identify Alabama as the capital of Chicago. I knew all the state capitals. I knew major mineral resources. Missouri: lead and zinc. (That's just an example.) I learned so many geographical facts that I've had to spend a lot of time in recent years trying to forget them so I'll have room in my brain for some things that may be more useful. I don't hold with the theory that everyone is just using a little bit of his gray matter. I think we're all going flat out.<br><br>For instance, I've worked hard to forget the longest word in the English language, which I had to learn for a high school club. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. It isn't a word that's easy to work into conversations. There are only so many times you can say, "Speaking of diseases usually contracted through the inhalation of quartz dust . . ." I finally managed to forget how to spell it, and I was able to remember my Army serial number.<br><br>I think my interest in geography grew from the long automobile trips across the country I used to take with my family as a child. I grew up in Kansas City, which is what the real estate people would call equally convenient to either coast. We usually went west. My father would be in the front seat, pointing out buttes and mesas, and my sister, Sukey, and I would be in the back, protecting our territory. We had an invisible line in the center of the seat. At least, Sukey said it was in the center.<br><br>There were constant border tensions. It was sort of like the border between Finland and the old Soviet Union. I played Finland. Sukey played the Soviet Union. Then my father did something that we now know was politically retrograde and maybe antifeminist. He told me, "We do not hit girls. You will never hit your sister again." Sukey was not visited with a similar injunction. So I became a unilaterally disarmed Finland, while she was a Soviet Union bristling with weaponry. If I hadn't had to be on constant alert because of Sukey's expansionist backseat policy, I might now know the difference between a butte and a mesa.<br><br>If I had followed my geographical bent, I would have become a regionalist, a geographer who decides where to draw the lines dividing the regions of the United States, like the Midwest and the South and the New England states. Actually, I do the same sort of thing, without a degree, except I only use two regions-partly because of my math. Math was my worst subject. I was never able to convince the mathematics teacher that many of my answers were meant ironically. Also, I had trouble with pi, as in "pi r squared." Some years ago, the Texas State Legislature passed a resolution to change pi to an even three. And I was for it.<br><br>The way I divide up the country, the first region is the part of the United States that had major league baseball before the Second World War. That's the Ancien United States, or the Old Country. The rest of the United States is the rest of the United States-or the Expansion Team United States.<br><br>For those of you who didn't follow baseball closely in 1948, there's an easy way to know whether you're in the Old Country or the Expansion Team United States. In the Old Country, the waiters in an Italian restaurant have names like Sal or Vinnie. If you're in an Italian restaurant and the waiter's name is Duane, you're in the Expansion Team United States.<br><br>1988<br><br>Spelling Yiffniff<br><br>My father used to offer an array of prizes for anyone who could spell yiffniff. That's not how to spell it, of course-yiffniff. I'm just trying to let you know what it sounds like, in case you'd like to take a crack at it yourself. Don't get your hopes up: This is a spelling word that once defied some of the finest twelve-year-old minds Kansas City had to offer.<br><br>The prizes were up for grabs any time my father drove us to a Boy Scout meeting. After a while, all he had to say to start the yiffniff attempts was "Well?"<br><br>"Y-i . . . ," some particularly brave kid like Dogbite Davis would say.<br><br>"Wrong," my father would say, in a way that somehow made it sound like "Wrong, dummy."<br><br>"How could I be wrong already?" Dogbite would say.<br><br>"Wrong," my father would repeat. "Next."<br><br>Sometimes he would begin the ride by calling out the prizes he was offering: ". . . a new Schwinn three-speed, a trip to California, a lifetime pass to Kansas City Blues baseball games, free piano lessons for a year, a new pair of shoes." No matter what the other prizes were, the list always ended with "a new pair of shoes."<br><br>Some of the prizes were not tempting to us. We weren't interested in shoes. We would have done anything to avoid free piano lessons for a year. Still, we were desperate to spell yiffniff.<br><br>"L-l . . . ," Eddie Williams began one day.<br><br>"Wrong," my father said when Eddie had finished. "Next."<br><br>"That's Spanish," Eddie said, "the double L that sounds like a y."<br><br>"This is English," my father said. "Next."<br><br>Sometimes someone would ask what yiffniff meant.<br><br>"You don't have to give the definition to get the prizes," my father would say. "Just spell it."<br><br>As far as I could gather, yiffniff didn't have a definition. It was a word that existed solely to be spelled. My father had invented it for that purpose.<br><br>Occasionally some kid in the car-usually, the contentious Dogbite Davis-would make an issue out of yiffniff's origins. "But you made it up!" he'd tell my father, in an accusing tone.<br><br>"Of course I made it up," my father would reply. "That's why I know how to spell it."<br><br>"But it could be spelled a million ways."<br><br>"All of them are wrong except my way," my father would say. "It's my word."<br><br>If you're thinking that my father, who had never shared the secret of how to spell his word, could have simply called any spelling we came up with wrong and thus avoided handing out the prizes, you never knew my father. His views on honesty made the Boy Scout position on that subject seem wishy-washy. There was no doubt among us that my father knew how to spell yiffniff and would award the prizes to anyone who spelled it that way. But nobody seemed able to do it.<br><br>Finally, we brought in a ringer-my cousin Keith, from Salina, who had reached the finals of the Kansas State Spelling Bee. (Although Keith, who eventually became an English professor, remembers the details of his elimination differently, I'm sure I was saying even then that the word he missed in the finals was "hayseed.") We told my father that Keith, who was visiting Kansas City, wanted to go to a Scout meeting with us to brush up on some of his knots.<br><br>"Well?" my father said, when the car was loaded.<br><br>"Yiffniff," my cousin Keith said clearly, announcing the assigned word in the spelling bee style. "Y-y . . ."<br><br>Y-y! Using y both as a consonant and as a vowel! What a move! We looked at my father for a response. He said nothing. Emboldened, Keith picked up the pace: "Y-y-g-h-k-n-i-p-h."<br><br>For a few moments the car was silent. Then my father said, "Wrong. Next."<br><br>Suddenly the car was bedlam as we began arguing about where our plans had gone wrong. "Maybe we should have got the guy who knew how to spell 'hayseed,' " Dogbite said. We argued all the way to the Scout meeting, but it was the sort of argument that erupts on a team that has already lost the game. We knew Keith had been our best shot.<br><br>1986<br>Doing My Talent<br><br>I can whistle and hum at the same time. It's my talent, in the way the Miss America people use the word talent-as in "Miss Minnesota will now do her talent." If the Miss America people announced that I would now do my talent, I would whistle and hum at the same time. I would probably whistle and hum "Stars and Stripes Forever," although I've also prepared "Buckle Down, Winsocki" in case of an encore. It's a secure feeling, knowing that you're ready if the Miss America people call.<br><br>I hate to use the phrase "God-given talent"-like a lot of people with God-given talent, I have always prided myself on my lack of pretense- but it's true that whistling and humming at the same time came to me naturally. I didn't work at it, the way I worked at being able to blow a hard-boiled egg out of the shell. It's more like my other talent, the ability to bark like a dog: One day I just realized I could do it.<br><br>I can whistle/hum anything, but I prefer "Stars and Stripes Forever" because it's a traditional song for people doing my sort of talent. On Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour, a program whose passing I lament, "Stars and Stripes Forever" was a staple. I once saw a man play it on his head with two spoons, varying the notes by how widely he opened his mouth. I suspect he had "Buckle Down, Winsocki" ready as an encore, even though they never did encores on Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour. "Buckle Down, Winsocki" is also traditional.<br><br>You might think that my ability to whistle and hum at the same time has always been a matter of pride in my family. I know the sort of scenes you're imagining. You see my wife at lunch with one of her friends. "It must be exciting being married to someone who can do a talent," the friend is saying. My wife smiles knowingly. You see my daughters as kindergartners bringing other kids home and begging me to show little Jason and Jennifer and Emma how I can whistle and hum at the same time. "Do 'Stars and Stripes Forever,' Daddy," they say. "Then do 'Buckle Down, Winsocki.' " I do both. Even little Jason looks impressed. "Jesus," he says. "I thought I'd seen everything."<br><br>That's not the way it has been at all. When my daughters were kindergartners, they never asked me to whistle and hum at the same time for their friends. Little Jason, I know for a fact, still hasn't seen everything, even though he's now sixteen years old. Now that my daughters are teenagers themselves, their response to a bit of spontaneous whistle/humming in a restaurant or an elevator tends to begin with "Daddy, please."<br><br>I don't know what my wife and her friends say to each other at lunch, but I have to consider the possibility that my wife rolls her eyes up toward the back of her head as her friend asks, "How's the old spoon player these days?" All this reminds me of what used to be said about the kid in my fourth-grade class who couldn't seem to catch on to math: "He doesn't get much encouragement at home."<br><br>Not that I expect special treatment. I'm not just being modest when I say that I think many people have similar talents, even if they don't always demonstrate them. I've always thought that of world leaders, even though a lot of them act as if they might have had too much encouragement at home. When I used to see pictures of General de Gaulle, I'd always think, "I bet that man can play 'Lady of Spain' on his head with a spoon. He may not want to, but he has the capacity." I believe that if you gave Helmut Kohl an ordinary pocket comb and some waxed paper, he could turn out a credible rendition of "Pop Goes the Weasel." I've always thought that Margaret Thatcher must be able to throw a lighted cigarette in the air and catch it in her mouth. I sometimes think that we would have been better off, and she would have been better off, if she had just gone ahead and done it.<br><br>Actually, I don't do my own talent in public anymore. Here's what happened: I was in Milwaukee on a book tour. Some people who had read about my talent came in the store and said that they had a man with them who could also whistle and hum at the same time. They suggested that the two of us might like to do a quartet. He was the chairman of the neurology department at the local medical school, although I don't think that had any connection to his talent. The talent I do is not deeply neurological. It's more like a God-given talent. At any rate, it turned out that this man could not simply hum and whistle at the same time. He could hum one tune while he whistled another tune. He could, to be specific, whistle "Goodnight, Irene" while humming "I'm in the Mood for Love." Well, right then, I packed it in.<br><br>But I still daydream about doing my talent. Sometimes, I imagine that Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour has been brought back to network television. I'm on the first show. I've whistled and hummed "Stars and Stripes Forever." They call for an encore. I'm ready.<br><br>1990</p><h2>A Writer&#39;s Diary</h2><p>The essential entries from Dostoevsky's complete <i>Diary</i>, called his boldest experiment in literary form, are now available in this abridged edition; it is a uniquely encyclopedic forum of fictional and nonfictional genres. <i>A Writer's Diary</i> began as a column in a literary journal, but by 1876 Dostoevsky was able to bring it out as a complete monthly publication with himself as an editor, publisher, and sole contributor, suspending work on <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> to do so.&nbsp;The <i>Diary</i>'s radical format was matched by the extreme range of its contents. In a single frame it incorporated an astonishing variety of material: short stories; humorous sketches; reports on sensational crimes; historical predictions; portraits of famous people; autobiographical pieces; and plans for stories, some of which were never written while others appeared later in the <i>Diary</i> itself. A range of authorial and narrative voices and stances and an elaborate scheme of allusions and cross-references preserve and present Dostoevsky's conception of his work as a literary whole.&nbsp;Selected from the two-volume set, this abridged edition of <i>A Writer's Diary</i> appears in a single paperback volume, along with a new condensed introduction by editor Gary Saul Morson.</p><p>Winner of the AATSEEL Outstanding Translation Award<br>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (Russian: &#x424;&#x451;&#x434;&#x43e;&#x440; &#x41c;&#x438;&#x445;&#x430;&#x301;&#x439;&#x43b;&#x43e;&#x432;&#x438;&#x447; &#x414;&#x43e;&#x441;&#x442;&#x43e;&#x435;&#x301;&#x432;&#x441;&#x43a;&#x438;&#x439;; IPA:&nbsp;[&#x2c8;f&#x2b2;od&#x259;r m&#x2b2;&#x26a;&#x2c8;xajl&#x259;v&#x2b2;&#x26a;t&#x255; d&#x259;st&#x250;&#x2c8;jefsk&#x2b2;&#x26a;j]&nbsp; ; 11 November 1821&nbsp;&#x2013; 9 February 1881 ) sometimes spelled Dostoevsky, was a Russian writer of novels, short stories and essays. Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society. Although Dostoyevsky began writing books in the mid-1850s, his best remembered work was done in his last years, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov. He wrote eleven novels, three novellas, seventeen short novels and three essays and is often acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest and most prominent psychologists in world literature.</p><h2>Turkey Trot Murder (A Lucy Stone Mystery)</h2><p><i>It&#x2019;s late autumn in Tinker&#x2019;s Cove, Maine, and the last surviving flowers on Lucy Stone&#x2019;s porch have fallen victim to the first frost of the season.

A topic often overlooked is how to create endbands (also called &#34;headbands&#34;), those structural and decorative bands made of plain linen or hemp, silk or cotton thread, that one can see at the head and tail of the spine of a book. This manual, written by two experienced book conservators, is an easy to use, step-by-step guide showing how to create fourteen different types of historical endbands. Separate chapters are devoted to each, with all the necessary materials listed at the beginning. Among the examples are Coptic, Ethiopian, Islamic, Greek, Armenian, French, Monastic, Renaissance, Italian, German, and modern styles. Each step is clearly illustrated and all the instructions have been tried out on students of the craft and perfected at the bench, so that the easiest and simplest method is presented. Written for both beginners and experienced binders, Endbands has established itself as one of the classic manuals for book conservators and hand bookbinders. This third edition of the now-classic manual originally titled &#34;Headbands: How to Work Them&#34; has been revised and updated by Jenny Hille. Revisions include: - New forward by Georgios Boudalis, an expert in Eastern Mediterranean bookbinding structures and especially in endbands. - Minor corrections and clarifications throughout, based on new scholarship, users&#39; suggestions, and consultation with experts. - Endbands grouped regionally (Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe), because the techniques are entirely different. - The technique for the Armenian endband has been completely revised, with new line drawings for the instructions. - The bibliography has been updated.</p><p>As a resource, the book is an excellent instruction manual for a wide variety of headbands that are not normally covered in general binding manuals. ... The directions are clear enough so that even a beginner should be able to follow them. The book would also appeal to book artists looking for new ways to snazz up their work. --Frank Lehman, Guild of Book Workers Newsletter<br><br>Since it was first published in 1986, Jane Greenfield and Jenny Hille's book on endbands has been for me and most, if not all, book conservators and bookbinders the foundation of our knowledge of endbands, of how to distinguish them and how to make them. --from the Foreword to the third edition by Georgios Boudalis</p><h2>Whistling Wings (Arbordale Collection)</h2><p>Marcel, a young tundra swan, is tired from the first half of a winter migration.

She currently resides in Norco, California, with her two Spanish Mustangs, Rio and Milagro.From 1903's <i>The Great Train Robbery</i> to 2003's <i>Seabiscuit</i>, horses have played a significant role in the annals of moviemaking. Mitchum (daughter of actor Robert Mitchum) and writer Pavia celebrate equine participation by spotlighting these underappreciated animal stars and their handlers. Identifying horses in films ranging from Westerns to romantic comedies, she tells their stories in encyclopedic detail. Though Roy Rogers's Trigger enjoyed star treatment, many others endured inhumane treatment. Errol Flynn was appalled at the cruelty shown toward horses in his 1936 film <i>The Charge of the Light Brigade</i>. Despite his protests, directors and stunt coordinators used painful and even lethal methods to obtain effects. While the American Humane Association exerted some influence in the 1940s, their power waned in the '60s. It took 20 years for animal safety to return as a public issue. Indeed, Mitchum contends it's up to audiences to let producers know their films won't be respected if they don't "treat their hardworking equine and other animal cast members with the respect they so richly deserve." Animal lovers in particular will enjoy the tricks of the trade Mitchum discusses, such as the proper way to teach a horse to fall on cue. The authors give insight into an oft-ignored aspect of filmmaking. Photos. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Back in the day, the Hairpin featured a smorgasbord of advice columns to suit almost any conundrum that might present itself, but none specifically targeted the trials and tribulations of LGBTQ women and the folks who love them. I had never written an advice column before, but as soon as I pitched the idea to then-editor Edith Zimmerman, she was eager to get it going. The column&#x2019;s name and the mascot, a fluffy baby chick with a pink bow on its head, were her idea.</p><p>Initially, I had some concerns that it would be difficult to collect enough questions to keep Ask A Queer Chick going on a regular basis, and I even considered writing a few fake letters myself based on Past Lindsay&#x2019;s relationship troubles. But as soon as the first column was published, emails came rolling in. It turned out there were quite a few queer chicks reading, and they had questions&#x2014;boy, did they. The last few years have been a time of exhilarating highs and disheartening lows for the LGBTQ community. With the legal and social climate surrounding queer issues changing so quickly, it was hard for young people to figure out which way was up, much less navigate the obstacle course of coming out and finding love. Dating, sex, being a person in the world&#x2014;these are things most of us learn by example, from big sisters and older friends and classmates in school. We need the guidance and wisdom of someone who&#x2019;s already lived through it, but for queer people, those role models are often difficult to find, if not totally nonexistent.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what this book is here for. No, it won&#x2019;t tell you foolproof ways to meet hot, available women (although I can tell you that my friend Mickey introduced me to the person I ended up marrying, so maybe hit her up). Instead, it will talk you through some of the major roadblocks you might face on your journey through the joy and heartache of queerness, and offer time-tested tips on confidence, communication, self-advocacy, and generally being the best possible version of yourself, so that when you find the person who makes your heart (and genitals) sing, you can sweep her off her feet. Whether you&#x2019;re struggling with discovering who you are, coming out, hookups, breakups, or anything in between, <i>Ask a Queer Chick</i> is here to help you get through it with style, wit, and self-love.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been answering your questions for four years, from &#x201c;Did I wait too long to come out?&#x201d; to &#x201c;How should I introduce my girlfriend to my homophobic parents?&#x201d; to &#x201c;Is it okay to wear nail polish if I&#x2019;m gonna, you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve struggled with all these issues in my own life, and I know the feeling of wishing your heart came with an owner&#x2019;s manual. You&#x2019;ve been told over and over that &#x201c;it gets better,&#x201d; but that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean it gets any easier. So you like girls, but does that make you bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, pansexual, or just curious? What about all those secret code words and gestures that every girl but you seems to know already? And now that marriage might be on the table, all your (cool) relatives are probably lining up to ask when you&#x2019;re going to walk down the aisle, even if you have no idea whether you ever want to get married. What&#x2019;s a lady-lover to do?</p><p>In <i>Ask a Queer Chick</i>, you&#x2019;ll learn the answers to all these questions and more, from social etiquette (dating your friends&#x2019; exes, you&#x2019;ll be glad to learn, is <i>much</i> more acceptable among queer folk than in the straight community) to sex toy etiquette (rechargeables make you look environmentally conscious and therefore more attractive). We&#x2019;ll talk about how to get dates (an obviously gay haircut isn&#x2019;t required, but let&#x2019;s be honest, it helps) and the basics of relationship maintenance (stand between her and your craziest relative when you bring her home for Christmas).</p><p><i>Ask a Queer Chick</i> will also guide you through some of the less sexy aspects of being queer, like what to do when coming out might mean losing your job, and handling your relationships with bigoted family members. We&#x2019;ll talk about the legal protections at your disposal, what to do when they don&#x2019;t work, and how you can give back to the community. We&#x2019;ll chat about biphobia in both the straight and gay communities, and how to fight it. We&#x2019;ll also discuss the particular challenges queer trans women face, and how cis women can help.</p><p>Is This Book for Me?</p><p>Throughout <i>Ask a Queer Chick</i>, I&#x2019;ll be addressing most of the common&#x2014;and more than a few of the uncommon&#x2014;questions I&#x2019;ve received in my years dispensing advice. I&#x2019;ve abandoned the Q-and-A format for a more general approach, and all of what you&#x2019;ll read here is new writing, though I&#x2019;ve touched on many of these topics before. But before we really get into it, there is one topic I want to address right up front. By far the most common question I encounter is some version of the following: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting to suspect that my sexual orientation and/or gender are not entirely standard, but I&#x2019;m not sure. Aren&#x2019;t LGBTQ people supposed to know who they are, from diapers on? How do I know whether I&#x2019;m gay or bi or queer or maybe genderqueer, or if this is just a phase? Who the hell am I?&#x201d;</p><p>First, some bad news: I don&#x2019;t know! I have no psychic powers, nor does this book include a handy Myers&#x2013;Briggs-style test to determine the truth of your orientation, gender, or identity. Who you are and what you call yourself is something that only you get to, or can, decide.</p><p>Now for the good news: You don&#x2019;t have to know yet, either! The words we use to describe ourselves&#x2014;&#x201c;straight,&#x201d; &#x201c;gay,&#x201d; &#x201c;bi,&#x201d; &#x201c;trans,&#x201d; &#x201c;fluid&#x201d;&#x2014;are all just approximations; none of them really captures the complexity of our glorious and specific lives. They&#x2019;re ways to describe how you feel and what you do, and most important, they&#x2019;re something you get to choose. There is no right or wrong answer.</p><p>Some people will try to convince you that you have only one true identity, and that your job is to find it, possibly by acquiring and following some sort of Lord of the Rings&#x2013;style treasure map. These people may be either well-intentioned or malicious, but they are definitely not correct. You&#x2019;re not born with a single identity that is perfect and immutable. The core of who you are doesn&#x2019;t change, but how you feel, what you do, and what you call yourself may vary based on your experiences, your stage of life, even your location.</p><p>If there&#x2019;s a word that you think might suit you, try it on for a week or a month or a year, and see how it feels. Maybe it will be a perfect fit; maybe it will be a little too tight in the shoulders and you&#x2019;ll want to trade it in, or at least make some alterations. Or maybe it will feel great at first, but you&#x2019;ll start to feel a bit of a pinch as time goes on. All of these things are okay! Exchanging one word for another doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean you were wrong the first time; it just means that you&#x2019;re growing and changing and trying new things and learning more about yourself. That&#x2019;s something to be proud of.</p><p>Having an identity that feels right, that feels true, can be a great source of confidence and strength, and knowing others with the same or similar identities can create a sense of much-needed community, as well as the opportunity to work together to meet common goals and overcome common obstacles. However, the pressure to know what your identity is, to pick a label with absolute certainty and commit to it, never wavering, for the rest of your days, can sometimes be counterproductive. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re not sure, right now, whether you&#x2019;re gay or queer or pansexual or straight or homoromantic or any of the fascinating and nuanced words that humans have come up with to describe how they feel and what they like to do, because the feeling and the doing are the only parts that really count.</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve picked up this book and you don&#x2019;t already identify as a member of the LGBTQ community, you&#x2019;re probably either related to me (hi, Aunt Bobbi! Thanks for being so supportive! Don&#x2019;t read Chapter 4), or your feelings (or doings) have been kicking up some questions in your life. I encourage you to embrace those questions, and follow them where they lead you, without worrying overmuch about what to call yourself in the meantime. Listen to your heart, even when it isn&#x2019;t making much sense; that&#x2019;s how you learn to speak its language. And remember that defining your identity is, in the long run, actually one of the less difficult challenges you&#x2019;ll ever face on your quest to obtain lifelong happiness.</p><p>A Note on the <i>T</i> Word</p><p>It&#x2019;s fairly common to lump the issues faced by transgender people in with those faced by gay, bi, and queer people under the catchall umbrella LGBTQ, or sometimes LGBTQIA (the last two letters standing for &#x201c;intersex&#x201d; and &#x201c;asexual,&#x201d; respectively). This can be useful in terms of creating solidarity, but it can also elide the fact that the challenges of being trans are not always the same as the challenges of being attracted to your own gender.</p><p>As a cisgender queer chick, I am not qualified to write in depth about trans issues, so while some of what I have to say will apply to the whole LGBTQIA community, this is primarily a book for women who date and/or sex up other women. If you&#x2019;re a trans chick whose sexual and romantic compass points dudeward, you may find certain sections helpful, but a lot of the relationship advice isn&#x2019;t going to be relevant to your life. If, however, you&#x2019;re a gay/lesbian/bi/queer trans woman, this book is for you as much as for anyone else. In several places, you&#x2019;ll find sage wisdom from other queer trans women who were kind enough to let me interview them on the particular joys and struggles of being a trans lady who digs other ladies. All girls who like girls are extremely welcome at this party.</p><p>With That Said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re here, you&#x2019;re at least an honorary member of our happy little club, so enjoy yourself! At the end of the day, it&#x2019;s not about what you call yourself or how many Tegan and Sara lyrics you remember; it&#x2019;s about figuring out what you want and going after it, as bravely and honestly as possible. And then figuring out that, no, that&#x2019;s not actually what you want at all, and starting all over again from square one&#x2014;and enjoying yourself along the way.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Coming Out</p><p>For some people, coming out is the first stage in a lifelong journey of queer adventures; others don&#x2019;t get around to it until they&#x2019;ve already been partaking of queer relationships and subcultures for years. Most of us within the LGBTQ community have come out and will continue to come out many times, and in many ways, throughout the course of our lives. It can be a daunting process, so this chapter is here to help you handle its highs and lows, whether you&#x2019;re coming out for the first time or the fifteenth.</p><p>When Should I Come Out?</p><p>The first&#x2014;and by far the most difficult&#x2014;step in the coming-out process is deciding whether you need to come out in the first place, and if so, what to come out as. In other words, you have to figure out who you are, what you want, and the words you&#x2019;re comfortable using to describe those things. This may involve reading some books, talking to out LGBTQ people you know, or getting by with a little help from Google&#x2014;or all of the above. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s an essentially solitary process, and one that I can offer you little help in getting through. But the nice thing is that once you&#x2019;ve done it, the hardest part is over.</p><p>Which is not to say that the next part is easy. Once you&#x2019;ve made up your mind that you belong somewhere within the kaleidoscope of identities that is the LGBTQ community, there&#x2019;s a complicated calculus that goes into deciding the right time to come out. Every one of us has to figure it out for herself, but here&#x2019;s the simplified version: You should come out when the problems caused by staying in the closet are bigger than the problems that would be caused by coming out.</p><p>The downsides of coming out are obvious; in fact, you&#x2019;ve probably had a stress dream or five about them: rejection, alienation, having to pretend to like <i>The L Word</i>. There are even times when it&#x2019;s downright dangerous to come out, which we&#x2019;ll discuss later in this chapter.</p><p>But staying in the closet has its drawbacks, too. Many closeted queers feel a lot of insecurity in their relationships with friends or family members, because they&#x2019;re withholding what is, for most of them, a key part of their identities. They begin to ask themselves questions like &#x201c;How can I trust someone to love me if they don&#x2019;t really know me? What if someone finds out? What will they say?&#x201d;</p><p>In addition, it&#x2019;s awfully hard to get laid when you&#x2019;re closeted. Because, listen, do you know who queer chicks do not go around hitting on? Straight chicks. We all went through a phase where we had a crush on a straight girl, and it was totally heart-wrenching. It devastated our confidence and our self-respect, and we&#x2019;ve sworn on a stack of Sarah Waters novels that we will never go there again. So if you ever want to know the sweet touch of someone else&#x2019;s boobs, coming out is definitely going to be your best bet.</p><p>Whenever you start to feel as if you just can&#x2019;t take the secrecy&#x2014;or the celibacy&#x2014;anymore, here are some options to consider.</p><p>The One-on-One</p><p>This is the classic coming-out move. You sit down with someone you care about, pour them a glass of wine (because unless they have a drinking problem, emotional revelations are always better with wine), look into their eyes, and with as little preamble as possible say &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gay.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bisexual,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m transgender&#x201d;&#x2014;whatever truth you&#x2019;ve been holding inside. Be prepared to explain your preferred terminology and why you chose it. If you&#x2019;ve been keeping secrets about your relationships or other important facets of your life because bringing them up would out you, now is the time to mention them.</p><p>Do everything in your power to keep yourself from apologizing. I know it&#x2019;s tempting, especially if the person you&#x2019;re talking to gets upset, but apologizing tells them you&#x2019;ve done something wrong, and you haven&#x2019;t. You don&#x2019;t have to be sorry for not coming out sooner, either; it&#x2019;s okay to keep that information to yourself until you feel safe and comfortable disclosing it.</p><p>This technique is a winner because it&#x2019;s simple, it&#x2019;s intimate, and it gives you the chance to have a nuanced conversation. The person you&#x2019;re coming out to can ask questions, and you can explain anything you need to. You can also include more than one person in the conversation, of course, but it works best if everyone involved already knows each other well&#x2014;you probably shouldn&#x2019;t invite your boss or your BFF from college to be present when you come out to your parents.</p><p>In some ways, this is the scariest method of coming out,...</p></p><h2>Winter in Madrid: A Novel</h2><p><b>A&nbsp;#1 internationally&nbsp;bestselling&nbsp;novel set in post-Civil War Spain by the author of <i>Dominion</i>&nbsp;and the Matthew Shardlake Tudor Mystery series</b>September 1940: the Spanish Civil War is over, Madrid lies in ruin, while the Germans continue their march through Europe, and General Franco evades Hitler's request that he lead his broken country into yet another war. Into this uncertain world comes a reluctant spy for the British Secret Service, sent to gain the confidence of Sandy Forsyth, an old school friend turned shady Madrid businessman. Meanwhile, an ex-Red Cross nurse is engaged in a secret mission of her own. Through this dangerous game of intrigue, C. J. Sansom's riveting tale conjures a remarkable sense of history unfolding and the profound impact of impossible choices.</p><p><b>C. J. Sansom</b>, the internationally bestselling author of&nbsp;the novels&nbsp;<i>Winter in Madrid</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Dominion</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Matthew Shardlake Tudor Mystery series,&nbsp;earned a Ph.D. in history and was a lawyer before becoming a full-time writer.The playing fields of Rookwood did little to prepare reluctant spy Harry Brett for the moral no man's land of post&#x2013;Civil War Spain that awaits him in this cinematic historical thriller from British author Sansom (<i>Sovereign</i>). But those halcyon days have made him one of the few people likely to win the confidence of fellow old boy Sandy Forsyth, now a shady Madrid businessman, Franco associate and object of intense curiosity to British intelligence. Despite his reservations, Brett&#x2014;whose best friend from Rookwood, Bernie Piper, disappeared in Spain a few years earlier while battling Franco with the International Brigade&#x2014;accepts the assignment as his duty, and almost as swiftly regrets it. For the Madrid he finds has become a mockery of the vibrant, hopeful place he and Bernie visited during the dawn of the Republic. As in his Matthew Shardlake mystery series set in Tudor London, Sansom deftly plots his politically charged tale for maximal suspense, all the way up to its stunning conclusion. A bestseller in the U.K., this moving opus leaves the reader mourning for the Spain that might have been&#x2014;and the England that maybe never was. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bara looks the Army Ballistic Missile Agency�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s proposed Project Horizon which was a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a scientific / military base on the Moon. On June 8, 1959, a group at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) produced for the U.S. Department of the Army a report entitled Project Horizon, A U.S. Army Study for the Establishment of a Lunar Military Outpost. The permanent outpost was predicted to cost $6 billion and was to become operational in December 1966 with twelve soldiers stationed at the Moon base. Wernher von Braun, head of ABMA, appointed Heinz-Hermann Koelle to head the project team at Redstone Arsenal. Their plans called for 147 early Saturn A-class rocket launches to loft spacecraft components for assembly in low Earth orbit at a spent-tank space station. A lunar landing-and-return vehicle would have shuttled up to 16 astronauts at a time to the base and back. While officially Project Horizon was scrapped by the military, or was it? Bara looks into the secret space program, the possibility of secret bases on the Moon and many rumors surrounding the military�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s secret projects in space.<br><br>The book will ask and answer many questions. Was Wernher von Braun involved in the Roswell crash investigation? Why did he suddenly become fascinated with highly advanced theoretical physics propulsion systems during the Apollo years, and why did all of this public research suddenly �&#x20ac;&#x153;go black�&#x20ac; in the early 1960s? Did NASA and the Pentagon know and expect to find evidence of alien bases on the Moon? Did the Apollo 12 astronauts deliberately damage the TV cameras in order to hide their explorations of one of these bases? What was the top secret �&#x20ac;&#x153;Chapel Bell�&#x20ac; experiment on Apollo 16? Has teleportation been developed from captured alien technology and used to transport humans to secret NASA/DOD bases on Mars? Do space shuttle videos taken in the 1990s show proof of a highly advanced secret US space fleet? Does hacker Gary Mackinnon�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s discovery of defense department documents identifying �&#x20ac;&#x153;non-terrestrial officers�&#x20ac; serving in space mean that the US has secret space platforms designed to fight a war with an alien race?

Consciousness Is What I Am addresses the most important and least understood aspects of the subject what consciousness is and how it can be opened to God s infinity. The book proceeds from a brace of provocative insights into human and divine nature. Goldsmith perceives consciousness both as a definition of the Self and as an entryway to true wisdom and to unlocking one s inner potential. With the grace and skill of a great teacher, Goldsmith ushers the reader progressively deeper into the sanctuary and secrets of the inner world. The journey begins with a discussion of how consciousness can be spiritually expanded and a description of the experience and state of heightened consciousness. Goldsmith also teaches the reader how to gain spiritual discernment. Along the way, he points out the landmarks by which we can recognize advancing consciousness, reveals the possible pitfalls for the traveler, and offers mu</p><p>JOEL S.

Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers.

In this captivating book, newly available in paperback, Yogananda's story finally has the authoritative telling it deserves. <br><br>Considered by many to be the father of modern yoga, Yogananda has had an unsurpassed global impact thanks to the durability of his teachings, the institutions he created or inspired, and especially his iconic memoir, Autobiography of a Yogi. Since its publication in 1946, that book has sold millions of copies and changed millions of lives. But it doesn't tell the whole story. <br><br>Much of Yogananda's seminal text is devoted to tales about other people, and it largely overlooks the three vital decades he spent living, working, and teaching in America. Huge chunks of his life--challenges, controversies, and crises; triumphs, relationships, and formative experiences--remain unknown to even his most ardent devotees. Scholar and teacher Philip Goldberg fills the gaps, charting a journey that spanned six decades, two hemispheres, two world wars, and unprecedented social changes. The result is an objective, thoroughly researched account of Yogananda's remarkable life in all its detail, nuance, and complex humanity.<br><br>But this is more than a compelling life story. "Yogananda would, I believe, want any book about him to not only inform but transform," Goldberg writes. "It is my hope that readers will be enriched, expanded, and deepened by this humble offering." That is sure to be the case for both Yogananda enthusiasts and those who discover him for the first time in these illuminating pages.</p><p><b>Philip Goldberg</b> grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Los Angeles.

It shows how the focus of Matthew shifts, from Jesus teaching about who he is to teaching mainly about what his church is.</p><p>Recognized as a masterly commentary when it first appeared, Frederick Dale Brunerbs study of Matthew is now available as a greatly revised and expanded two-volume work -- the result of seven years of careful refinement, enrichment, and updating.<p>Through this commentary, crafted especially for teachers, pastors, and Bible students, Bruner aims bto help Godbs people love what Matthewbs Gospel says.b Brunerbs work is at once broadly historical and deeply theological. It is historical in drawing extensively on great church teachers through the centuries and on the classical Christian creeds and confessions. It is theological in that it unpacks the doctrines in each passage, chapter, and section of the Gospel. Consciously attempting to bridge past and present, Bruner asks both what Matthewbs Gospel "said" to its first hearers and what it "says" to readers today. As a result, his commentary is profoundly relevant to contemporary congregations and to those who guide them.</p><p>Brunerbs commentary is replete with lively, verse-by-verse discussion of Matthewbs text. While each chapter expounds a specific topic or doctrine, the bookbs format consists of a vivid, original translation of the text followed by faithful exegesis and critical analysis, a survey of historical commentary on the text, and current applications of the text or theme under study. In this revision Bruner continues to draw on the best in modern scholarship -- including recent work by W. D. Davies and Dale C. Allison Jr., by Ulrich Luz, and by many others -- adding new voices to the reading of Matthew. At the same time he cites the classic commentaries of Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Bengel, and the rest,who, like Bruner himself, were not simply doctrinal teachers but also careful exegetes of Scripture. Such breadth and depth of learning assure that Brunerbs "Matthew" will remain, as a reviewer for "Interpretation" wrote, bthe most dog-eared commentary on the shelf.b</p><p>Volume 2 of Brunerbs commentary is called "The Churchbook" because Bruner sees Matthew 13-28 as concerned primarily with the life of the church and discipleship. Continuing his Volume 1 "Christbook" exposition, Bruner shows here how the focus of Matthew shifts, from Jesus teaching about "who he is" to teaching mainly about "what his church is." Brunerbs "Churchbook" commentary divides the second half of Matthew according to its major ecclesiological themes: the churchbs faith (chapters 13-17), the churchbs love (18-20), the churchbs history (21-23), the churchbs hope (24-25), and the churchbs passion (26-28).</p><p>Eminently readable, rich in biblical insight, and ecumenical in tone, Brunerbs two-volume commentary on Matthew now stands among the best in the field.</p>Frederick Dale Bruner is Wasson Professor Emeritus of Religion at Whitworth College, Spokane, Washington.</p><h2>Yes Means Yes!: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World without Rape</h2><p><b>This groundbreaking feminist classic dismantles the way we view rape in our culture and replaces it with a genuine understanding and respect for female sexual pleasure. </b><br>In the original edition, feminist, political, and activist writers alike presented their ideas for a paradigm shift from the "No Means No" model--and the result was the groundbreaking shift to today's affirmative consent model ("Yes Means Yes," as coined by this book). <br><br>With a timely new introduction, refreshed cover, and the timeless contributions of authors from Kate Harding to Jill Filipovic,<i> Yes Means Yes</i> brings to the table a dazzling variety of perspectives and experiences focused on the theory that educating all people to value female sexuality and pleasure leads to viewing women differently, and ending rape. <i>Yes Means Yes</i> has radical and far-reaching effects: from teaching men to treat women as collaborators and not conquests, encouraging men and women that women can enjoy sex instead of being shamed for it, and ultimately, that our children can inherit a world where rape is rare and swiftly punished.</p><p><b>Jaclyn Friedman's </b>work has redefined the concept of "healthy sexuality" and popularized the "yes means yes" standard of sexual consent that is quickly becoming law on many U.S. campuses.

Isolated and desolate, they were largely overlooked by early explorers until Charles Darwin arrived there in the 1830&#39;s. It was Darwin who recognized that Gal�pagos&#39; isolation and desolation were advantages: the paucity of species and lack of outside influences made the workings of natural selection crystal clear. Since then, every important advance and controversy in evolutionary thinking has had its reflection on the Gal�pagos. In every sense-intellectually, institutionally, and culturally-the history of science on these islands is a history of the way evolutionary science was done for the past 150 years.Evolution&#39;s Workshop tells the story of Darwin&#39;s explorations there; the fabulous Gilded Age expeditions, run from rich men&#39;s gigantic yachts, that featured rough-and-ready science during the day and black-tie dinners every night; the struggle for control of research on the Gal�pagos; the current efforts by &#34;creation scientists&#34; to use the Gal�pagos to undercut evolutionary teaching; and many other compelling stories.</p><p>When Europeans first explored the Galapagos Islands, a rugged archipelago 650 miles off the coast of Ecuador, they were astounded by the forbidding landscape and the odd behavior of the animals and plants they found there. "The place is like a new creation," wrote ship captain George Anson, a nephew of the poet Lord Byron. "The birds and beasts do not get out of our way; the pelicans and sea-lions look in our faces as if we had no right to intrude on their solitude; the small birds are so tame that they hop upon our feet; and all this amidst volcanoes which are burning around us on either hand."<p> Others who followed, like the onetime sailor and writer Herman Melville, took a dimmer view, calling the place "evilly enchanted ground." Whatever the sentiment, the Galapagos attracted generations of scientists, who, following the example of Charles Darwin, traveled there to test theories of speciation, adaptation, migration, and selection. Their work in the field helped overturn the prevailing orthodoxies of special creation, writes Edward J. Larson in his vigorous history of the islands and their role in the development of modern biological science. Their work also changed the face of the islands themselves, as hundreds and thousands of plants and animals were killed or removed for collections far afield, with a single expedition taking more than 10,000 birds and skins.</p><p> Today, the islands face other threats, as tens of thousands of ecotourists travel there each year, disturbing sensitive environments, and as alien plant and animal species are introduced. Still, Larson notes at the close of his fine book, "the archipelago's ecosystem has proved surprisingly resilient in the past," and conservation measures may yet be found to preserve the islands' "age-old solitude." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Edward J.

Sometimes it takes an adventurer with fiery soul to go where others fear to tread, taking the proverbial snake by its tail and propounding fresh new theories. Jim Barfield is one such unlikely researcher, whose quest for the secrets of the mysterious Copper Scroll has led him on an unparalleled excursion into the most controversial arena of ancient biblical scholarship, touching on hundreds of tons of buried gold and silver and even the fabled Ark of the Covenant.

But what makes this book unforgettable is the core of intense emotion at the heart every poem.<br><br>Max has been dealt a bleak but fertile subject: the result is not, as one might expect of an artist so young, a poetry of harsh autobiographical intimacy. What happens in these pages is an expansion, not a contraction; its result is an increased freedom and boldness and daring. The poems are alive with imperatives (as they must be when time is short), but urgency is everywhere conjoined with invention. When the poems do touch, directly and dramatically, on mortality, they are simultaneously candid and radically direct or brief, as in 'Second Dream': everything on the page is essential.<br><br><i>Four Reincarnations</i> is one of the most original and ambitious first books in my experience. Max Ritvo sounds like no one else this is the rarest of all possible gifts and means that, at their best, these poems do things in the language that haven't been done."<br><br><b> Louise Gl�ck</b><br><br> A Max Ritvo poem is:<br>A map drawn by hand to show where the body is buried.<br>A card trick with words . . . 'Don&#x2019;t show me how you did it.'<br>Like reading the last sentence in a book first.<br>Dragging words across the page like a bow across a string.<br>A piece of candy covered with ants.<br>Like silverfish ate the words off a page . . . and left you a riddle.<br>All of the above."<br><br><b> Tom Waits</b><br><br>"In <i>Four Reincarnations</i>, Max Ritvo brings us along where poetry needs to go; away from the small confessional and into a big world of death, love, and metaphysics. While allowing for the possibility of a confessional mode in the details, Ritvo&#x2019;s poems take stock of the nineteenth-century sublime, adding the contemporary death of God, and going forward with bravery, irony, and the most compassionate sense of humor. The relationship he hews between language and the body is both original and hard won. His lyric complicity is between self, dedicatee, reader, and world. Ritvo&#x2019;s ear for language is beautiful, as is his spirit. His poems defy solipsism and enter a cosmology of unconditional love. How lucky I am that I found Max Ritvo and his poetry; he makes me love poetry again."<br><br><b> Sarah Ruhl</b><br><br>"This is poetry written in the dark light of dying young. You feel the truth of this poetry too deeply to want to talk about it in your own words. You want to give it to other people still back here in health, to say to them, 'Here: the earthly gift of this poet of genius, Max Ritvo.' To Max himself, we might say what he says to his wife in one of these poems: 'Thou art me before I am myself.' In the sense, not of death, but of most ardent life."<br><br><b> Jean Valentine</b><br><br>"If you could confect a numinous cauldron and stir into it the lumens of Christopher Smart&#x2019;s Spiritual Musick, the spirit-hounds of Hopkins&#x2019; 'terrible crystals,' the hysteria of Monty Python&#x2019;s antics, the grace and depth of Keats&#x2019;s early wisdoms, you would render incarnate the first and final book of Max Ritvo&#x2019;s <i>Four Reincarnations</i>. The poems flicker like fireflies let loose from their captivity in a mason jar, fulgurating like Nobodaddy&#x2019;s business. Somehow, somewhere, Ritvo must have begun as an infant scholar, a prodigy, a young man of the rarest and most prescient gifts. This is a dazzling collection, rife with life, and with death, impending. This book, then, will be the afterlife. Ritvo&#x2019;s work is extracelestial, riddled with brilliance and with ecstasies. We are lucky to have this luminous collection in our world. It will go on. And then on."<br><br><b> Lucie Brock-Broido</b><br><br>"Armed with intelligence, valor, audacity, and grace, Max Ritvo&#x2019;s imagination pushes back against one grim reality after another in its insistence on celebrating being embodied in the first place. No poet I can think of undertakes the transmutation of suffering into art with anything resembling Ritvo&#x2019;s wild theatricality, inclusiveness, and tonal range. Dizzying, out of proportion, poundingly felt, fantastical, fanatical, urgently constructed, confessional, gaudy, absurd, mystic, harrowing the fact that Ritvo&#x2019;s work can be described in so many ways is testament to its complexity. The fact that we can never quite describe it in full is evidence of its irreplaceability. The fact that it haunts so many of its readers is proof that it has already become a necessary and sustaining part of us some measure of our acquired wisdom, some portion of our vision of what it means to be alive."<br><br><b> Timothy Donnelly</b><br><br>"Silly, sweet, and sad all at once. Ritvo was able to revel in the absurdity&#x2015; and poignancy&#x2015;of his condition."<br><br><b><i> O, The Oprah Magazine</i></b><br><br>"Vital and unflinching poems that emerge from the unflagging energy of a mind embedded within, yet constantly struggling beyond, the suffering of his body. Ritvo's poems sizzle over the all-to-brief fire of his hungry and staggering imagination."<br><br><b><i> Publishers Weekly</i> (Starred Review)</b><br><br>"By turns carnal and cerebral, prophetic and pragmatic, crude and contemplative, Ritvo's voice is a wildly imaginative and frenetic force."<br><br><b><i> Booklist</i> (Starred Review)</b><br><br>"Seen as a leading poet of his generation, Ritvo was diagnosed with cancer in his teens and died in August at age 25. In breathtaking language, he chronicles not what it&#x2019;s like to be dying but what it&#x2019;s like to be living."<br><br><b><i> Library Journal</i> (Starred Review)</b><br><br>"Ritvo has left behind a rich collection of poetry that emboldens us to bravely inhabit our bodies and to look toward the future."<br><br><b><i> Guernica</i></b><br><br>"There is no doubt in my mind that Max Ritvo's first and only poetry collection is among my favorite books that I have ever read, to say nothing of only 2016."<br><br><b><i> Adroit Journal</i></b><br><br> "Compelling, relatable, and heartbreaking&nbsp;. . . there is deliberate, conscious artistry [in <i>Four Reincarnations</i>]."<br><br><b>&#x2015;<i>Kenyon Review</i></b><br><br> "Max Ritvo's debut poetry collection, which unflinchingly addresses his cancer diagnosis, ranges from the sublime to the profane.

The horse is untrained, but incredibly fast and Steve just wants to show him off. When two strangers show up and offer to make Steve&#x2019;s dream a reality, Steve cannot believe his luck. But soon he realizes that a professional racetrack is no place for an unbroken stallion.</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.The tropical sun was hot and brilliant. It made the open waters of the Caribbean Sea appear more blue than they actually were. It turned the golden, rounded dome of Azul Island into a flaming apparition. Yet its rays could not pierce the mist which hung like a gray veil about the base of this island of stone. Blue waters churned white going over the protective reef that lay a short distance out, then turned black as the waves gathered momentum and height to disappear behind the heavy shroud. They could be heard seconds later crashing against the walled barriers of Azul Island.<br><br> A lone boy guided the motor launch Sea Queen toward the perilous reef, his eyes never leaving the waters directly before him. He handled the wheel carefully, expertly. He watched the submerged coral slide past to either side of the hull. He seemed to know this particular area well. He piloted his launch in an ever alternating course, but one that took him always closer to the gray mist.<br><br> His name was Steve Duncan. He was no experienced mariner, for only recently had he been given the privilege and the responsibility of guiding the Sea Queen between the two islands of Antago and Azul, a distance of more than twenty miles. His home was in a small city in the United States, and he was on summer vacation from school. He wore a T-shirt and shorts. His body was deeply tanned from weeks spent beneath this hot, tropical sun, and the corners of his eyes were cracked with the white lines that come from squinting in the glaring sunlight for hours at a time. His black hair was cut short and uncovered.<br><br> He could have been any average and normal American boy . . . except for what he was about to do. In that respect, he did not conform to rule or type or standard.<br><br> He took the Sea Queen into the gray mist. If he heard the heavy thud of waves crashing hard against the wall of stone beyond, it did not seem to frighten him. He went in a direct line now. The engine throbbed noisily as though in protest to the mounting surge of the sea that would hurl it forward too fast. No longer could Steve see the dome-shaped top of Azul Island. He watched only for the precipitous wall that soon would rise a thousand and more feet above him.<br><br> Like the island itself, the approach foreboded danger. But Steve Duncan welcomed it, for it had kept all other people away. Now he began moving the wheel often again, and the propeller was reversed to steady the launch and hold it back from sweeping against the wall of stone that suddenly loomed ahead.<br><br> Steve had left the doors of the low sea hole open, and now he skillfully took the launch through it and into the narrow canal which cut the floor of a large chamber within Azul Island. He moored the launch to moss-covered piles that were centuries old, and for a second he thought of the men from the Spanish galleons who had sunk them so long ago. Then he crossed the sandy floor of the chamber and closed the sliding partitions above the sea entrance. There was less light and wind now, but the waters in the canal still flooded and ebbed with the waves that found their way through the opening at the base of the hole.<br><br> Hurriedly Steve left the chamber and went down the tunnel which would take him to where he wanted to be more than any other place in the world. As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light he ran faster, never once looking at the coral rock in brilliant shades of pink, green, gray and white that had always attracted his attention before. Nor did he give another thought to the Spanish Conquistadores who had brought their men, weapons and horses along this path in their final flight from the English and French. For it belonged to the far distant past, and Steve Duncan was interested only in the present and the great red stallion who awaited him.<br><br> He emerged from the tunnel and entered a long chasm, not bothering to glance up at the sky above the close, sheer walls on either side of him. He ran faster, breathing easily but becoming very excited. Soon he arrived at a small sliver of a valley, and crossed the stream that cut its center. Still he ran on till he came to a rock-strewn gorge. There he slowed down to a walk, for the trail was jagged and twisting. He went down the dry river bed, following the gorge until he came to a wide patch of marshland. Here he went a little faster but he didn't run. He hated this particular area with its high reeds, swamp ferns and the thick vapors whose stench of rotting vegetation had been made worse by the sweltering afternoon sun. He held his breath as long as possible between short gasps of the foul air, his eyes remaining fixed on the narrow green swath of solid ground before him. He saw Flame's oval-shaped hoofprints and it made this part of the trip a little easier to bear. Soon he'd be with his stallion. There was only a short distance to go now.<br><br> Finally his path led upward, taking him from the hollow that fostered and nurtured the marsh. He began running again, leaving the dense vapors far behind. He climbed higher--and then, just beyond a field of wild cane, he saw Blue Valley! At the upper end a band of horses grazed. A few of them were drinking from a pool that was fed by a waterfall dropping a hundred feet or more down the precipitous wall.<br><br> Steve Duncan stopped then and whistled as loud as he could. In answer, a lone stallion emerged from the band . . . a tall chestnut horse whose mane and tail seemed to move like burning flame when he broke into a gallop. Steve ran to meet him.</p><h2>The Name of this Book Is Secret (The Secret Series, Book 1)</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><b>Read the series that's sold more than 2 million copies--if you dare!</b><br><i><br>Warning: </i><i>this description has not been authorized by Pseudonymous Bosch.</i> As much as he'd love to sing the praises of his book (he is very vain), he wouldn't want you to hear about his brave 11-year old heroes, Cass and Max-Ernest.

A lonely bunny goes hunting for Easter, where he hopes to find other bunnies. His search takes him through the seasons, but only in the spring does he find the true meaning of Easter. To this heartwarming story Helen Craig has lent her own original interpretation. As multiple stories unfold in each piece of art, viewer and reader are drawn into the poetic, song-filled text. This new rendition of an old classic is sure to charm readers young and old.</p><p>Charlotte Zolotow was a legendary children&#x2019;s book editor and author. She wrote more than seventy picture books for children in her lifetime.<br><br>Helen Craig has illustrated more than sixty books for children, including the Angelina Ballerina books. She lives in England.A rite of spring is glorified again in a newly illustrated edition of an old-fashioned, childlike book that was first published in 1959. A sleepy bunny wakes alone in the woods, wanting the company of other rabbits. He asks help from an owl but is told only that there are always rabbits at Easter. Thinking Easter is a place east of where he is, he sets out to find it, dressed in a vest and looking dapper. His quest takes him through many experiences and locales, such as a daisy field where ``in all that whiteness of daisies there was no whiteness of bunnies like himself,'' and a snowy stretch where ``his footprints never crossed other bunny footprints.'' The rabbit's melancholy is built up expertly in the text, but slightly offset by the presence in the illustrations of a perky little mouse accompanying the rabbit on his search, which eventually leads to a joyous union with a bunny in a pink print dress. Craig tempers comic scenes with dramatic ones: Exaggerated elements, such as the overabundance of apples on a tree and the improbable number of fawns in a ``family of deer,'' contrast with a thunderstorm. The text overcomes any small flaws with its mood, and its appeal to the sensibilities of a tender age. (Picture book. 3-7) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Although most of these accounts appeared before the Civil War, more than one-third are the result of the ambitious efforts of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to interview surviving ex-slaves during the 1930s. The result of these efforts was the Slave Narrative Collection&#x2015;a group of autobiographical accounts of former slaves that today stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. Compiled in seventeen states during the years 1936-38, the collection consists of more than two thousand interviews with former slaves, most of them first-person accounts of slave life and the respondents' own reactions to bondage. The interviews afforded aged ex-slaves an unparalleled opportunity to give their personal accounts of life under the "peculiar institution," to describe in their own words what it felt like to be a slave in the United States.<br>&#x2015;Norman R.

This book provides those of us who may have quickly read past biblical references to Jesus as the Son of God, thinking we have grasped the meaning of the term, with a tour of its variations and implications throughout Scripture, putting it in context of the failure of previous sons&#x2015;Adam, Israel, and Solomon&#x2015;so we might grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy Guthrie,</strong> Bible teacher; author, <em>Even Better than Eden: Nine Ways the Bible&#x2019;s Story Changes Everything about Your Story</em></p><p>&#x201c;Goldsworthy has provided serious Bible students an excellent treatment of why and how God the Son took on flesh to save the children of God for the kingdom of God. Linking New Testament themes to their Old Testament sources, Goldsworthy demonstrates the importance of the unity of the Bible, union with Christ, and hope based in God&#x2019;s coming kingdom.

This is not just a fine study of a biblical theme, but an excellent example of sound biblical-theological method.

Webb,</strong> Senior Research Fellow Emeritus in Old Testament, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;There are many rich and vibrant themes that course throughout the Bible, and Goldsworthy has traced the idea of the Son of God with clarity, precision, and discernment. The Scriptures are massive, but with this little book we have a clear line of sight to learn more about the significance of this idea, whether as sons of God or as we contemplate the glory of the one and only Son of God, Jesus Christ. Anyone can profit from reading this study from one of today&#x2019;s insightful biblical theologians.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. V. Fesko,</strong> Professor of Systematic and Historical Theology, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>&#x201c;In this worshipful book, Goldsworthy focuses on the incarnate Son of God as the climax of redemptive history and considers how his role relates to his also being God the Son as part of the Trinity.

No Brotherhood has been held accountable for either rite. Instead, the Brothers responsible have been rewarded and protected under every Administration. Told from the vantage point of 2019, when all the Earth is convulsing and the United States of America is collapsing, Sub Rosa America: A Deep State History relates the 1970 pilgrimage of a band of Sixties refugees heading east on the Route 66 Mother Road through a military quantum Time field experiment, en route to Dallas to see where the Camelot king was shot down on television like a dog. Their intent is to know the truth, and so, as in Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, they attract dreamers and the dead bent on elucidating the occult underpinnings of what they will have to reckon with in their brief, all-too-human lives . . .</p><p>In August 1963, Elana Freeland was sixteen when she represented her state at Girls Nation in Washington, DC and stood in the Rose Garden with President John F.

Knowing that God has planned for the church to be trained through such circumstances will help readers to accept what they usually go to great lengths to avoid. Billheimer shows clearly that it is not the mere presence of pain in our lives that gives benefit, however. It is in a proper response to it that God is able to mature and prepare His church for her glorious future as the reigning bride of Christ. Christians of all ages learn how the difficulties they encounter in life can work for their good--if they don't "waste" them.</p><p>GOD'S TRAINING GROUND FOR HIS CHILDREN<br><br>God's sometimes surprising tools for maturing and training His church are clearly explained in this eye opening discussion on the role of suffering in a Christian's life. You will be amazed at the depth of spiritual growth possible for those who continue to trust God during life's difficulties.<br><br>ARE YOU STRUGGLING THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME?<br><br>Knowing that God has planned for you to benefit from this sorrow, you can learn to respond in a brand-new way--not seeing it as a punishment or interruption but as an opportunity to grow into your unique role as Christ's eternal bride.<br><br>So don't waste your sorrows...embrace them with an attitude that will ensure they produce God's best in you. It will bring a brand-new joy and purpose to every circumstance that comes your way.Paul E. Billheimer authored several enduring books concerning the body of Christ, including <i>Destined for the Throne</i>, <i>Love Covers, Destined to Overcome, </i>and <i>Destined for the Throne</i>. He and his wife began a tent ministry in Anderson, Indiana, in 1936 that grew to include a Bible institute, a Christian high school and day school, and eventually a Christian television station. In their later years they worked with Trinity Broadcasting Network. They were married for sixty-three years and raised three children.

IN THE TOWN OF SPOON RIVER, ILLINOIS, the dead have been given one final opportunity to speak to the living in the form of epitaphs. Take a stroll through the graveyard; the words on each tombstone create an image of the way the person&#39;s life was lived. Together, these tombstones tell of a community that strove for perfection and goodness and relied heavily on faith-but, things don&#39;t always turn out as planned... Discover their secrets, heartaches, and regrets; sympathize with their guilt, anger, and sorrow; mourn with those the dead left behind; wander through the history these individuals made through their actions. Ultimately, this cemetery tells of lives that were far from perfect- sometimes, they were even far from good. Through their epitaphs, it becomes clear that these townspeople-neighbors, friends, lovers, family members, and even murderers-saw each other very differently, but now, they all are at rest, as equals, sleeping on the hill.</p><p></p><h2>Your Best Life Now (Special 10th Anniversary Edition): 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential</h2><p><b>Live boldly and act on your most powerful beliefs with this life-changing guide to faith, positive thinking, and spiritual fulfillment.</b><br>Pastor Joel Osteen asks everyone to examine what he or she really believes. Why is this important? Because we will become what we believe. Our beliefs will prove either a barrier or vehicle as we strive to go higher, rise above our obstacles, and to live in health, abundance, and victory.<br><br>In <i>Your Best Life Now</i>, Osteen says, "I am what I am today because of what I believed about myself yesterday. And I will be tomorrow what I'm believing about myself right now. God sees us as more than conquerors, able to fulfill our destiny. We need to see ourselves through the eyes of our Creator." He says that our self-image should mirror exactly what God says about us, not what we feel or think. And he encourages readers to be people of faith, for if you can see the invisible, God will do the impossible.<br></p><p>Houston televangelist Joel Osteen is well qualified to write this book, having used the seven principles he shares to achieve his own "rags-to-riches" story. At the heart of Osteen&#x2019;s message is that achieving a successful, prosperous life of fulfillment can only occur when we stop worrying about the past or future to make the most of each present moment by using our God-given strengths and talents to achieve our goals. The key to doing so are the seven steps Osteen outlines: Enlarge Your Vision, Develop a Healthy Self-Image, Discover the Power of Your Thoughts and Words, Let go of the Past, Find Strength Through Adversity, Live to Give, and Choose to Be Happy. Mixing biblical teachings with his own personal experiences, Osteen explains each of these seven steps in an encouraging, optimistic manner that makes them accessible to anyone interested in principles of personal growth. Although written with a Christian slant, the seven steps Osteen shares will have value to anyone wanting to know more about practical steps of self-betterment, regardless of their denomination.--<i>Larry Trivieri Jr.</i>JOEL OSTEEN is the author of ten New York Times bestsellers and the senior pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston.

It provides a valuable tool, both for understanding your own psyche and for using astrology to help others.</p><p>This approach to understanding of the psychology of the person through holistic interpretation of the horoscope was developed by Bruno, Louise and Michael Huber at the Astrological Psychology Institute (API) in Adliswil near Zurich, over many years of research, consultation and teaching work.</p><p>Already a classic since it was first published in English in 2005, this new revised edition has colour illustrations, enabling full appreciation of the power of this approach, where the colours in the chart are of great significance.</p><p>This book gives a systematic introduction to the practical use of this method, using many example horoscopes and diagrams. More than 45 distinct aspect figures are identified, each with a different meaning.</p><p>Whether you are an astrological novice or an experienced astrologer, aspect patterns can provide immediate significant revelations about yourself and other people.</p><p>This book is a basic reference work on astrological psychology - every serious student should have one!</p></p><p>November 29, 1930 - November 3, 1999 Bruno Huber was a Swiss astrologer and psychologist. In 1968, with his wife, Louise Huber, he founded Astrological Psychology Institute, which became an internationally-renowned school of Astrology. It was run according to humanist and psychological principles, based on Dr. Roberto Assagioli's theory of Psychosynthesis. The school initially offered personal teaching, and then professional Diploma training from 1973. Huber schools were subsequently established in UK and Spain. The Hubers' teachings were gradually crystallised into books, which have subsequently been translated into many languages. Their holistic method of Astrological Psychology has a worldwide following. The young Bruno Huber had a voracious interest in astrology, psychology and philosophy, but became disillusioned with the practice of astrology at that time. In 1952 he met astrologer and esotericist Louise, discovering an immediate common bond. They married a year later and lived in the lively intellectual environment of Z�rich. In 1956 they were involved for two years with setting up a branch of the Arcane School in Geneva, giving a strong spiritual grounding to their subsequent work. In 1958, Bruno was invited to Roberto Assagioli's Psychosynthesis Institute in Florence, which led to the pair spending three years there assisting with running of the Institute and the documentation of Assagioli's psychosynthesis. During this period Bruno was able to perform extensive research into the horoscopes and psychological profiles of Assagioli's patients, and eventually he developed the revolutionary theories on horoscope interpretation that became the basis for Astrological Psychology, or Huber Astrology. Of particular note is the use of colour in the chart, the separation of the five levels of the chart, the significance of the aspect pattern as an indicator of motivation, the psychological interpretation of the houses, the energy intensity curve in the houses, the levels of operation of the planets and aspects, the Life Clock, the use of three charts including the House and Moon Node charts, the dynamic calculations, the use of spiritual indicators in the chart... In 1963 Bruno &amp; Louise returned to Z�rich. After a further period of exploration, in 1968, Bruno &amp; Louise began to give seminars on the results of their researches, and the Astrological Psychology Institute was founded. A lively following soon developed in Zurich, and the teaching activities developed apace, going further afield in Switzerland and Germany, and then at international conferences, and in USA, UK, Spain and Brazil. By the early 2000s tens of thousands of students had been through the courses, and equivalent courses were available in Spain and in UK. By 1974 the need to crystallise the Huber teachings in books had become evident, a publishing company was formed, and a series of books gradually emerged; most have subsequently been published in English and in Spanish. The astrological psychology magazine Astrolog was established in 1981 and continues to this day. The Hubers were also heavily involved in organising and presenting at three-yearly World Astrology Conferences in Switzerland. In 1991 Bruno had a heart attack, which forced him to slow down somewhat. Although Bruno was still involved in teaching, their son Michael took on some of the load. In 1999 Bruno died, and the work was subsequently taken forward by Louise, Michael and a strong cohort of teachers who had been involved with API for many years. The fruitful partnership between Bruno and Louise can be characterised astrologically: Bruno was the creative inventor of new astrological structures (Uranus) whereas Louise was the elemental force that created the forms and structures of the Institute that brought them to fruition in the world (Saturn).<br><br>10th May 1924 - 13th January 2016 Louise Huber was a Swiss astrologer and esotericist.

API closed down shortly thereafter, but the teachings seeded by Bruno &amp; Louise go on in courses and books.<p>Extract from a review of the first edition, by Sue Lewis: </p><p>Whether you have just finished reading Joyce Hopewell's and Richard Llewellyn's delightful introduction, <em>The Cosmic Egg Timer</em>, or have been using the Huber method for consultations for many years, you will find rich insights into motivation in Aspect Pattern Astrology that add to your understanding of the whole person and what drives each individual forward on his or her unique journey.</p><p>This dense volume goes into great detail to explain where aspect patterns lie in the five level interpretation of the horoscope, which aspects are used and why, how the effectiveness of the operation can depend on the sympathy or antipathy of planet and aspect, the reasoning behind half-way aspects, and how all aspects and their patterns can be expressed at physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels...</p><p>Like many key references this book extends what we know and also raises questions. We all need it to develop our understanding of aspect patterns and it will stimulate us to ask more questions and explore more charts.

His words were eloquent, comprehensive, and simple, conveying libraries of wisdoms and truths. The Messenger (upon him be peace) himself said, I have been sent with the jawami al-kalim (Bukhari) that is, pithy language that expresses a multitude of meanings in few words. Bookstores and libraries today are full of books of proverbs, coined by historical personages and political and religious leaders. But each of these pales in comparison to the eloquence of the Messenger of God (upon him be peace) and philosophers and sages seem nothing more than struggling students in the light of his divinely inspired wisdom. This book is a collection of 327 hadiths which the author, Shaykh &#39;Ashiq Ilahi al-Bulandshehri, compiled from &#39;Allama Tabrizi s renowned hadith compilation, Mishkat al-Masabih. The book contains many jawami&#39; al-kalim, as well as prophecies and other accounts and narratives. The book is ultimately a compilation of hadiths meant to inspire the souls of today s Muslims and give them a glimpse at the charisma of the Prophet Muhammad (upon him be peace) and a roadmap with which they can achieve closeness to their Lord. This work is taught in many of the madrasas around the world as a first hadith work. Now it is available in this beautifully bound English edition with a commentary from the classical sources.</p><p>Mufti Abdur-Rahman ibn Yusuf Mangera, has been studying the traditional Islamic sciences and writing scholarly works for most of his life. He completed the bulk of his studies at Darul Uloom Bury, North England, where he memorized the Qur an by age fifteen and thereafter went on to complete a rigorous, six-year Shari a program. He graduated from this program with authentic certifications [ijaza] in numerous Islamic disciplines, including Arabic, Islamic jurisprudence, and hadith (with particular emphasis on the six authentic books of hadith [Sihah Sitta] and the Muwattas of Imam Malik and Imam Muhammad). His teachers at Darul Uloom Bury included Shaykh Yusuf Motala and other students of Shaykh al-Hadith Mawlana Muhammad Zakariyya Kandhlawi. Shaykh Ashiq Ilahi al-Bulandshehri a prolific writer and eminent scholar of the Indian Subcontinent, Shaykh Ashiq Ilahi al-Bulandshehri (or al-Barni) was born in 1343 ah in Bulandshehr of Uttar Pradesh. After attaining his primary education at Madrasa Imdadiyya Moradabad and Jami Masjid Aligarh, he traveled to Mazahir Ulum Saharanpur in pursuit of higher knowledge. After completing his studies, he taught various subjects at Ferozpur Jhirka, Hayat al-Ulum Moradabad, and at different madrasas throughout Calcutta. He later taught at Dar al- Ulum Karachi for several years at the request of Mufti Muhammad Shafi , where he assumed responsibility of the fatwa department and taught students hadith and tafsir. The Shaykh later migrated to Madina, where he spent the last 25 years of his life. He was a disciple of the hadith scholar Shaykh Muhammad Zakariyya Kandhlawi. Dozens of his books have been well received in many countries. Tohfa-e khawatin (Gift for women), Marne ke bad kya! h ga? (What is going to happen after death?), Islami adab (Islamic conduct), Huquq al-walidayn (Rights of parents), and Anwar al-bayan (Illuminating discourses on the Holy Qur an), a voluminous commentary of the Qur an, are among the well-known books he authored. In the field of hadith, he authored Zad al-talibin (Provisions for the seekers) and Al-Fawa id al-saniyya fi sharh al-Arba in al-Nawawiyya (The lofty beneficial points in the explanation of Nawawi s Forty Hadiths).

In her many years of ministry, research and teaching, author Diana Garland has found that the strength of Christian families is rooted in their faith and nurtured in their congregations. Garland believes that Christian families gain strength in part because of their communities of faith. Twelve years after first coming to print, the award-winning <em>Family Ministry</em> has been given a significant makeover. In this new edition Garland takes a three-pronged approach to family ministry, which includes developing families grounded in Christian faith, helping families live the teachings of Jesus with one another, and equipping and supporting families as they learn to serve others. The insights gained are organized into four main sections: <ul><li>The Context for Family Ministry</li><li>Family Formation</li><li>Family Dynamics</li><li>Leading Family Ministry</li></ul> Garland examines and fully integrates the historical, sociological, theological and biblical contexts to understand the role and meaning of family in the life of Christians and the church. She perceptively connects these explorations with the social and cultural context of the early twenty-first century.</p><p><strong>Diana R. Garland</strong> is dean of the Baylor School of Social Work at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Her other books include <em>Sacred Stories of Ordinary Families, Church Social Work</em> and <em>Flawed Families of the Bible</em> (with David Garland)."Diana Garland uses reasoned, comprehensive methods to put understanding in the context of our personal and casual observations. Sometimes her conclusions confirm that we're on the right track. In other instances, she finds out we're missing the mark and need to change our strategy completely. At each step, she includes personal stories that take the concepts from the research lab to the living room and challenge us to do what we do better, for all the right reasons." (Reggie Joiner, founder and CEO of Orange)<br><br>"<em>Family Ministry: A Comprehensive Guide</em> is a gift to everyone in church leadership and ministry with families. Diana Garland accomplishes the almost impossible--blending history, theology, family theory and pastoral practice into one book that is a must-have resource for everyone who works with families. Diana's knowledge, experience and wisdom are woven into each chapter of the book. <em>Family Ministry</em> provides congregations with vision and practices for ministry with families in the 21st century." (John Roberto, editor, Lifelong Faith journal, author, Faith Formation 2020: Designing the Future of Faith Formation)<br><br>"If you think you know about family ministry, think again. This handbook on family ministry provides the biblical, historical and research-based approach to family ministry. It is a gem that could serve as the foundation for anyone engaged in family ministry. The book is loaded with compelling research, heart-tugging stories and practical suggestions for implementing and improving church-based family ministry. Don't miss this one!" (Dr. Eric Swanson, Leadership Network, coauthor of The Externally Focused Church and To Transform a City)<br><br>"This second edition of Diana Garland's groundbreaking resource for the church, <em>Family Ministry</em>, builds on the qualities that made the first edition so important. It is deeply informed by biblical theology, understanding practical needs of families in local church communities, and ongoing research. Dr. Garland is dean of the Baylor University School of Social Work and has for years led major research studies on families in the church and community ministry. With her husband David Garland, dean of Truett Theological Seminary at Baylor, she is coeditor of <em>The Journal of Family and Community Ministries</em>. Her book is substantive and engaging--full of well-grounded stories and applications for family ministry."

The text is divided into three parts which deal respectively with the special theory of relativity, with the general theory of relativity, and with considerations on the universe as a whole. The special theory deals with the physics of elementary particles while the general theory is concerned with the force of gravity and its effect on the other forces of nature. These two theories, while exceptional in their explanations of their particular focus, are inconsistent with each other, and it has long been an aim of the science of physics to help resolve these inconsistencies. Einstein proposed that, rather than discarding these two principles for their contradictions, the rules of time and space should be completely rethought in order to harmonize our understanding of the physical world. Einstein&#x2019;s work in the field of theoretical physics would earn him the Nobel Prize in 1921 and establish his legacy as one of the most famous scientists of all time. This edition is translated by Robert W. Lawson and is printed on premium acid-free paper.</p><p>How better to learn the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity than directly from their creator, Albert Einstein himself? In <i>Relativity: The Special and the General Theory,</i> Einstein describes the theories that made him famous, illuminating his case with numerous examples and a smattering of math (nothing more complex than high-school algebra). Einstein's book is not casual reading, but for those who appreciate his work without diving into the arcana of theoretical physics, <i>Relativity</i> will prove a stimulating read."The additions to the original text give considerable insight and are a valuable addition, particularly for anyone approaching the subject for the first time."<br> &#x2014;<i>Choice</i> <br><br> "It&#x2019;s as though you are sitting in his classroom, watching [Einstein] alternate between gesticulating and chalking equations onto the blackboard."<br> &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><h2>Everything You Always Wanted to Know about God (But Were Afraid to Ask): The Jesus Edition</h2><p>With a healthy dose of wit and a heaping helping of wisdom, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Eric Metaxas answers questions about Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and much more.</p><p><b>Eric Metaxas</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery</i> and <i>Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy</i>.

This book, the product of over 13 years of writing and research, provides the best explanation yet offered of the true nature of the medical coverup in the assassination of JFK, and does so in meticulous detail, with scrupulous use of primary source material. It incorporates the latest information---much of it new evidence not revealed elsewhere---gleaned from the ARRB&#39;s depositions and interviews of medical witnesses. With precise accuracy, and with a relentless focus on the massive fraud uncovered in the official records of the 35th President&#39;s assassination, Horne presents a persuasive case that the assassination of JFK was an &#34;inside job,&#34; a true coup d&#39;etat in America, that was ruthlessly and brazenly covered up by those who &#39;broke the back of the American century&#39; in Dallas on November 22, 1963. IN VOLUME THREE, THE AUTHOR RELATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TWO FBI AGENTS WHO WERE PRESENT AT JFK&#39;S AUTOPSY; REVISITS THE CRUCIAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE DALLAS TREATING PHYSICIANS WHO SAW PRESIDENT KENNEDY&#39;S WOUNDS AT PARKLAND HOSPITAL (BEFORE THEY WERE LATER SURGICALLY ALTERED, AT BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CHANGE HISTORY); AND EXPLAINS IN DETAIL HOW INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CORRUPTED THE CASE BY PLACING FRAUD IN THE EVIDENCE. THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE IN THE CASE WAS HOPELESSLY TAINTED BY THE INSERTION OF DECEPTIVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF A SUBSTITUTE BRAIN INTO THE OFFICIAL RECORD; BY REWRITING THE AUTOPSY REPORT; AND THROUGH THE CREATION OF AN INTENTIONALLY DISHONEST AND MISLEADING COLLECTION OF AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS AND X-RAYS.

Gathered here are Fee's best studies and reflections on the art of attending to the biblical text critically yet with a deep spiritual sensitivity.

Fee is a Pentecostal pneumatologist without peer. In his largehearted service of the biblical text he is in every way a model. Brilliant and simple, these chapters will enrich all who take the Bible seriously."</p><h2>Rise of the Jumbies</h2><p><b>Deep beneath the waves, a great enemy awakens . . .</b><br><br> Corinne LaMer defeated the wicked jumbie Severine months ago, but things haven&#x2019;t exactly gone back to normal in her Caribbean island home.

But Mama D&#x2019;Leau&#x2019;s help comes with a price. Corinne and her friends Dru, Bouki, and Malik must travel with mermaids across the ocean to fetch a powerful object for Mama D&#x2019;Leau. The only thing more perilous than Corinne&#x2019;s adventures across the sea is the jumbie that waits for her back home.<br> &nbsp;<br> With action-packed storytelling and inventive twists on Caribbean and West African mythology and fairy tales, <i>Rise of the Jumbies </i>is a breathlessly exciting tale of courage and friendship.<br><br><b>An NPR Best Book of 2017<br> A Kirkus Reviews Best Book of 2017<br> A School Library Journal Best Book of 2017</b></p><p><b>Tracey Baptiste</b> lived in Trinidad until she was fifteen; she grew up on jumbie stories and fairy tales.

As other young children of the African diaspora sort out their feelings about and relationships with slavery, so do Corinne and her loyal friends. While other tales may address it with a casual aside or scrub out the grimiest bits, leaving history in a shiny, tidy package removed from reality, Baptiste allows her characters to find and create ways to grapple with uncomfortable truths.

Warning: this book contains graphic descriptions of sexual child abuse, perverse sex, Satanic Ritual Abuse, MK ULTRA mind control and torture. This book is only for adults and should be kept away from children. I felt that it was necessary to describe these experiences graphically to depict the wrongness of these child prostitution rings which are becoming so wide spread in our modern world. Consider the recent PizzaGate scandal. This book may be different than other books on SRA because of the unusual circumstances of my situation. Most people who get as close to the inner circle as I was don&#39;t live to tell the tale or they never escape the cult. My experiences may not be typical, but I do allow the reader to understand the emotional landscape of a child who is being brainwashed and sexually abused. I expose insider information about how child prostitution is involved with political and financial corruption. Persons who have read this story have told me that they have been moved by my honesty. This was a very difficult book to write. And threats have been made against me because I have published this. However it&#39;s my belief that ultimately the reader will find this to be a book that inspires hope rather than fear. I also talk about the courageous persons who helped me to escape the cult and become deprogrammed. And I talk some about the resistance movement that is working to undermine the satanic NWO. My intention in writing this book is that it be experienced as a story of spiritual redemption and liberation.</p><p></p><h2>Tales from Grimm (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage)</h2><p>Renowned children&#x2019;s book author Wanda G�g presents these classic Grimm tales, accompanied by whimsical illustrations. Drawing on her peasant heritage and childlike sense of wonder, G�g translated the fairy tales in a uniquely American vernacular tongue. In Tales from Grimm we find her touch on timeless stories like &#x201c;Hansel and Gretel,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Musicians of Bremen,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rapunzel,&#x201d; and others. No other editions of Grimm&#x2019;s fairy tales for children can match G�g&#x2019;s richness of prose and the humor, beauty, and sheer magic of her pictorial interpretation. Best known for her Newbery Honor winner Millions of Cats, Wanda G�g (1893&#x2013;1946) was a pioneer in children&#x2019;s book writing, integrating text and illustration. Born in New Ulm, Minnesota, she rose to international acclaim. In recognition of her artistry, she was posthumously awarded the 1958 Lewis Carroll Shelf Award for Millions of Cats and the 1977 Kerlan Award for her body of work.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>A Dictionary of Japanese Food: Ingredients and Culture</h2><p><b>Nominated for the Glenfiddich Food Book of the Year Award, this timeless volume is the first and only book of its kind on the subject.</b><br><br><i>A Dictionary of Japanese Food</i> helps food lovers around the world decipher the intricacies and nuances of Japanese cooking and its ingredients.

And indeed, judging from the opening spread's clear skies, sparkling water, zooming boats, and adventure-bound cars it looks to be so. The story begins as a scruffy little dog makes an appearance at a family's picnic. The children name him Willy, and by the end of the day they desperately want to take him home. The family drives away, but all week they can think of nothing but their new furry friend. They return to picnic at the same spot the very next week, much to Willy's good fortune--and that of the newly smitten family.<p> As in all the best illustrated children's books, Simont lets his pictures tell the story. We don't have to be told how wrenching it is for the kids to leave Willy behind--we see their small outstretched arms out the car window and the puppy watching them go. Simont doesn't have to tell us that the next Saturday the family is completely preoccupied with the possibility of another Willy sighting. We see the family, silent, munching, and just to the side is a plate of meat they've put out, just in case. Young readers will adore this simple tale of puppy love, but adults will be equally charmed. Simont illustrated his first book in 1939, and since then has illustrated nearly 100 titles, including the 1949 Caldecott Honor Book <i>The Happy Day</i>, by Ruth Krauss and Janice May Udry's <i>A Tree Is Nice</i>, winner of the 1957 Caldecott Medal. This book is our favorite so far of the year!

This is mine.</i><br><br>One summer in the sixties, in a staid suburb south of London, nineteen-year-old Paul comes home from university and is urged by his mother to join the tennis club. There he&#x2019;s partnered with Susan Macleod, a fine player who&#x2019;s forty-eight, confident, witty, and married, with two nearly adult daughters. She is a warm companion, her bond with Paul immediate. And soon, inevitably, they are lovers. <br><br> Basking in the glow of one another, they set up house together in London.

As he turns over his only story in his mind, examining it from different vantage points, he finds himself confronted with the contradictions and slips of his own memory&#x2014;and the ways in which our narratives and our lives shape one another.

That is, I think, finally, the only real question.<br>You may point out&#x2014;correctly&#x2014;that it isn&#x2019;t a real question. Because we don&#x2019;t have the choice. If we had the choice, then there would be a question. But we don&#x2019;t, so there isn&#x2019;t. Who can control how much they love? If you can control it, then it isn&#x2019;t love. I don&#x2019;t know what you call it instead, but it isn&#x2019;t love.<br>Most of us have only one story to tell. I don&#x2019;t mean that only one thing happens to us in our lives: there are countless events, which we turn into countless stories. But there&#x2019;s only one that matters, only one finally worth telling. This is mine.<br>But here&#x2019;s the first problem. If this is your only story, then it&#x2019;s the one you have most often told and retold, even if&#x2014;as is the case here&#x2014;mainly to yourself. The question then is: Do all these retellings bring you closer to the truth of what happened, or move you further away? I&#x2019;m not sure. One test might be whether, as the years pass, you come out better from your own story, or worse. To come out worse might indicate that you are being more truthful. On the other hand, there is the danger of being retrospectively anti-heroic: making yourself out to have behaved worse than you actually did can be a form of self-praise. So I shall have to be careful. Well, I have learned to become careful over the years. As careful now as I was careless then. Or do I mean carefree? Can a word have two opposites?<br>The time, the place, the social milieu? I&#x2019;m not sure how important they are in stories about love. Perhaps in the old days, in the classics, where there are battles between love and duty, love and religion, love and family, love and the state. This isn&#x2019;t one of those stories. But still, if you insist. The time: more than fifty years ago. The place: about fifteen miles south of London. The milieu: stockbroker belt, as they called it&#x2014;not that I ever met a stockbroker in all my years there. Detached houses, some half-timbered, some tile-hung. Hedges of privet, laurel and beech. Roads with gutters as yet unencumbered by yellow lines and residents&#x2019; parking bays. This was a time when you could drive up to London and park almost anywhere. Our particular zone of suburban sprawl was cutely known as &#x201c;The Village,&#x201d; and decades previously it might possibly have counted as one. Now it contained a station from which suited men went up to London Monday to Friday, and some for an extra half-day on Saturday. There was a Green Line bus stop; a zebra crossing with Belisha beacons; a post office; a church unoriginally named after St. Michael; a pub, a general store, chemist, hairdresser; a petrol station which did elementary car repairs. In the mornings, you heard the electric whine of milk floats&#x2014;choose between Express and United Dairies; in the evenings, and at weekends (though never on a Sunday morning) the chug of petrol-driven lawnmowers.<br><br>Vocal, incompetent cricket was played on the Village green; there was a golf course and a tennis club. The soil was sandy enough to please gardeners; London clay didn&#x2019;t reach this far out. Recently, a delicatessen had opened, which some thought subversive in its offerings of European goods: smoked cheeses, and knobbly sausages hanging like donkey cocks in their string webbing. But the Village&#x2019;s younger wives were beginning to cook more adventurously, and their husbands mainly approved. Of the two available TV channels, BBC was watched more than ITV, while alcohol was generally drunk only at weekends. The chemist would sell verruca plasters and dry shampoo in little puffer bottles, but not contraceptives; the general store sold the narcoleptic local <i>Advertiser &amp; Gazette</i>, but not even the mildest girlie mag. For sexual items, you had to travel up to London. None of this bothered me for most of my time there.<br>Right, that&#x2019;s my estate agent&#x2019;s duties concluded (there was a real one ten miles away). And one other thing: don&#x2019;t ask me about the weather. I don&#x2019;t much remember what the weather has been like during my life. True, I can remember how hot sun gave greater impetus to sex; how sudden snow delighted, and how cold, damp days set off those early symptoms that eventually led to a double hip replacement. But nothing significant in my life ever happened during, let alone because of, weather. So if you don&#x2019;t mind, meteorology will play no part in my story. Though you are free to deduce, when I am found playing grass-court tennis, that it was neither raining nor snowing at the time.<br>The tennis club: Who would have thought it might begin there? Growing up, I regarded the place as merely an outdoor branch of the Young Conservatives. I owned a racket and had played a bit, just as I could bowl a few useful overs of off-spin, and turn out as a goalkeeper of solid yet occasionally reckless temperament. I was competitive at sport without being unduly talented.<br><br>At the end of my first year at university, I was at home for three months, visibly and unrepentantly bored. Those of the same age today will find it hard to imagine the laboriousness of communication back then. Most of my friends were far-flung, and&#x2014;by some unexpressed but clear parental mandate&#x2014;use of the telephone was discouraged. A letter, and then a letter in reply. It was all slow-paced, and lonely.<br><br>My mother, perhaps hoping that I would meet a nice blond Christine, or a sparky, black-ringleted Virginia&#x2014;in either case, one of reliable, if not too pronounced, Conservative tendencies&#x2014;suggested that I might like to join the tennis club. She would even sub me for it. I laughed silently at the motivation: the one thing I was not going to do with my existence was end up in suburbia with a tennis wife and 2.4 children, and watch them in turn find their mates at the club, and so on, down some echoing enfilade of mirrors, into an endless, privet-and-laurel future. When I accepted my mother&#x2019;s offer, it was in a spirit of nothing but satire.<br>I went along, and was invited to &#x201c;play in.&#x201d; This was a test in which not just my tennis game but my general deportment and social suitability would be quietly examined in a decorous English way. If I failed to display negatives, then positives would be assumed: this was how it worked. My mother had ensured that my whites were laundered, and the creases in my shorts both evident and parallel; I reminded myself not to swear, burp or fart on court. My game was wristy, optimistic and largely self-taught; I played as they would have expected me to play, leaving out the shit-shots I most enjoyed, and never hitting straight at an opponent&#x2019;s body. Serve, in to the net, volley, second volley, drop shot, lob, while quick to show appreciation of the opponent&#x2014;&#x201c;Too good!&#x201d;&#x2014;and proper concern for the partner&#x2014;&#x201c;Mine!&#x201d; I was modest after a good shot, quietly pleased at the winning of a game, head-shakingly rueful at the ultimate loss of a set. I could feign all that stuff, and so was welcomed as a summer member, joining the year-round Hugos and Carolines.<br><br>The Hugos liked to tell me that I had raised the club&#x2019;s average IQ while lowering its average age; one insisted on calling me Clever Clogs and Herr Professor in deft allusion to my having completed one year at Sussex University. The Carolines were friendly enough, but wary; they knew better where they stood with the Hugos. When I was among this tribe, I felt my natural competitiveness leach away. I tried to play my best shots, but winning didn&#x2019;t engage me. I even used to practise reverse cheating. If a ball fell a couple of inches out, I would give a running thumbs up to the opponent, and a shout of &#x201c;Too good!&#x201d; Similarly, a serve pushed an inch or so too long or too wide would produce a slow nod of assent, and a trudge across to receive the next serve. &#x201c;Decent cove, that Paul fellow,&#x201d; I once overheard a Hugo admit to another Hugo. When shaking hands after a defeat, I would deliberately praise some aspect of their game. &#x201c;That kicker of a serve to the backhand&#x2014;gave me a lot of trouble,&#x201d; I would candidly admit. I was only there for a couple of months, and did not want them to know me.<br>After three weeks or so of my temporary membership, there was a Lucky Dip Mixed Doubles tournament. The pairings were drawn by lot. Later, I remember thinking: Lot is another name for destiny, isn&#x2019;t it? I was paired with Mrs. Susan Macleod, who was clearly not a Caroline. She was, I guessed, somewhere in her forties, with her hair pulled back by a ribbon, revealing her ears, which I failed to notice at the time. A white tennis dress with green trim, and a line of green buttons down the front of the bodice. She was almost exactly my height, which is five feet nine if I am lying and adding an inch.<br><br>&#x201c;Which side do you prefer?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Side?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forehand or backhand?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry. I don&#x2019;t really mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You take the forehand to begin with, then.&#x201d;<br><br>Our first match&#x2014;the format was single-set knockout&#x2014;was against one of the thicker Hugos and dumpier Carolines. I scampered around a lot, thinking it my job to take more of the balls; and at first, when at the net, would do a quarter-turn to see how my partner was coping, and if and how the ball was coming back. But it always did come back, with smoothly hit groundstrokes, so I stopped turning, relaxed, and found myself really, really wanting to win. Which we did, 6&#x2013;2.<br><br>As we sat with glasses of lemon barley water, I said,<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for saving my arse.&#x201d;<br><br>I was referring to the number of times I had lurched across the net in order to intercept, only to miss the ball and put Mrs. Macleod off.<br><br>&#x201c;The phrase is, &#x2018;Well played, partner.&#x2019;&#x201d; Her eyes were grey-blue, her smile steady. &#x201c;And try serving from a bit wider. It opens up the angles.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded, accepting the advice while feeling no jab to my ego, as I would if it had come from a Hugo.<br><br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The most vulnerable spot in doubles is always down the middle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, Mrs. Macleod.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Susan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re not a Caroline,&#x201d; I found myself saying.<br><br>She chuckled, as if she knew exactly what I meant. But how could she have?<br><br>&#x201c;Does your husband play?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My husband? Mr. E.P.?&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;No. Golf&#x2019;s his game. I think it&#x2019;s plain unsporting to hit a stationary ball. Don&#x2019;t you agree?&#x201d;<br><br>There was too much in this answer for me to unpack at once, so I just gave a nod and a quiet grunt.<br><br>The second match was harder, against a couple who kept breaking off to have quiet tactical conversations, as if preparing for marriage. At one point, when Mrs. Macleod was serving, I tried the cheap ploy of crouching below the level of the net almost on the centre line, aiming to distract the returner. It worked for a couple of points, but then, at 30&#x2013;15, I rose too quickly on hearing the thwock of the serve and the ball hit me square in the back of the head. I keeled over melodramatically and rolled into the bottom of the net. Caroline and Hugo raced forward in a show of concern while from behind me came only a riot of laughter, and a girlish &#x201c;Shall we play a let?,&#x201d; which our opponents naturally disputed. Still, we squeaked the set 7&#x2013;5, and were into the quarter-finals.<br><br>&#x201c;Trouble up next,&#x201d; she warned me. &#x201c;County level. On their way down now, but no free gifts.&#x201d;<br><br>And there weren&#x2019;t any. We were well beaten, for all my intense scurrying. When I tried to protect us down the middle, the ball went wide; when I covered the angles, it was thumped down the centre line. The two games we got were as much as we deserved.<br><br>We sat on a bench and fed our rackets into their presses. Mine was a Dunlop Maxply; hers a Gray&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I let you down,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;No one let anyone down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think my problem may be that I&#x2019;m tactically naive.&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, it was a bit pompous, but even so I was surprised by her giggles.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a case,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to call you Casey.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled. I liked the idea of being a case.<br><br>As we went our separate ways to shower, I said, &#x201c;Would you like a lift? I&#x2019;ve got a car.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at me sideways. &#x201c;Well, I wouldn&#x2019;t want a lift if you haven&#x2019;t got a car. That would be counterproductive.&#x201d; There was something in the way she said it that made it impossible to take offence. &#x201c;But what about your reputation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My reputation?&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve got one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh dear. We&#x2019;ll have to get you one then. Every young man should have a reputation.&#x201d;<br>Writing all this down, it seems more knowing than it was at the time. And &#x201c;nothing happened.&#x201d; I drove Mrs. Macleodto her house in Duckers Lane, she got out, I went home, andgave an abbreviated account of the afternoon to my parents.

Recognizing that competing with major record companies was a losing battle, Rupe headed to Central Avenue, the center of L.A.&#x2019;s black community, where he spent $200 on what were then known as &#x201c;race records.&#x201d; He carefully analyzed each, developing his own formula for a successful venture. Soon, Specialty was scoring R&amp;B hits with artists such as Roy Milton, Camille Howard, Jimmy and Joe Liggins, and Percy Mayfield. Drawn to the music of New Orleans, Rupe went on to sign Lloyd Price, who topped the charts with &#x201c;Lawdy Miss Clawdy.&#x201d; It was through Price that Specialty acquired its best-known artist, Little Richard. After &#x201c;Tutti Frutti&#x201d; exploded in 1955, Richard and the label scored a string of successes with &#x201c;Long Tall Sally,&#x201d; &#x201c;Lucille,&#x201d; &#x201c;Keep A Knockin&#x2019;,&#x201d; &#x201c;Good Golly Miss Molly,&#x201d; and more. In addition to R&amp;B and the emerging sounds of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, Rupe was particularly drawn to the sounds of the church. Black gospel music was an essential element of his company, with a roster that included stars of the genre, such as Sam Cooke&#x2019;s Soul Stirrers, Sister Wynona Carr, Brother Joe May, Alex Bradford and the Bradford Specials, and others. From behind-the-scenes producers Robert &#x201c;Bumps&#x201d; Blackwell, J.W. Alexander, Harold Battiste, and Sonny Bono, to R&amp;B recording stars Floyd Dixon, Guitar Slim, Jesse Belvin, Larry Williams, and Don and Dewey, this is the story of the legendary Specialty Records.</p><p>Art Rupe is a pioneering music industry executive and record producer. He launched Specialty Records, noted for its rhythm and blues, blues, gospel, and early rock and roll music recordings, in Los Angeles in 1946. Billy Vera is a singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, and music historian who wrote and recorded &#x201c;At This Moment,&#x201d; which was a #1 hit in 1987. He won a 2013 Grammy award for his notes for the Ray Charles Box set, Singular Genius: The Complete ABC Singles, and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Vera&#x2019;s other books include his memoir, Harlem to Hollywood; Vintage Neon: Los Angeles, 1979; and his forthcoming novel, A Dollop of Toothpaste.</p><h2>Fireside Catholic Youth Bible NEXT NABRE Hardcover</h2><p>This Bible was written for Catholic Teens to enable them to grow emotionally and spiritually in their Catholic faith and become effective Disciples of Christ. . 21 critical topics are addressed through seven comprehensive sections: Your Decision/Your Reward; What Does the Bible Say About?; Roots of Our Faith; Saints Relate; and 1 on 1 with Christ.

Now, when his young daughter Antigone defies her uncle, Kreon, the new ruler, because he has prohibited the burial of her dead brother, she and he enact a primal conflict between young and old, woman and man, individual and ruler, family and state, courageous and self-sacrificing reverence for the gods of the earth and perhaps self-serving allegiance to the gods of the sky.<br> Echoing through western culture for more than two millennia, Sophocles' <em>Antigone</em> has been a touchstone of thinking about human conflict and human tragedy, the role of the divine in human life, and the degree to which men and women are the creators of their own destiny. This exciting translation of the play is extremely faithful to the Greek, eminently playable, and poetically powerful.<br> For readers, actors, students, teachers, and theatrical directors, this affordable paperback edition of one of the greatest plays in the history of the western world provides the best combination of contemporary, powerful language, along with superb background and notes on meaning, interpretation, and ancient beliefs, attitudes, and contexts. <br><br>"Sophocles' text is inexhaustibly actual. It is also, at many points, challenging and remote from us. The Gibbons-Segal translation, with its rich annotations, conveys both the difficulties and the formidable immediacy. The choral odes, so vital to Sophocles' purpose, have never been rendered with finer energy and insight. Across more than two thousand years, a great dark music sounds for us."<br>--George Steiner, Churchill College, Cambridge<br><br>"Produces a language that is easy to read and easy to speak.... Enthusiastically recommended."--<em>Library Journal</em> [Starred Review]<br></p><p><p>In his long life, Sophocles (born ca. 496 B.C., died after 413) wrote more than one hundred plays. Of these, seven complete tragedies remain, among them the famed <i>Oedipus Rex</i> and <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>. In <i>Antigone</i>, he reveals the fate that befalls the children of Oedipus.<br>Polynices, son of Oedipus, has led a rebellious army against his brother, Eteocles, ruler of Thebes. Both have died in single combat. When Creon, their uncle, assumes rule, he commands that the body of the rebel Polynices be left unburied and unmourned, and warns that anyone who tampers with his decree will be put to death.<br>Antigone, sister of Polynices, defies Creon's order and buries her brother, claiming that she honors first the laws of the gods. Enraged, Creon condemns her to be sealed in a cave and left to die. How the gods take their revenge on Creon provides the gripping denouement to this compelling, frequently performed &nbsp;tragedy.</p><p></p><br><strong>Reginald Gibbons</strong> is the author of nine volumes of poems, including <em>Sparrow: New and Selected Poems</em>, <em>It's Time and Fern-Texts</em>.

Topics include: a natural construction of the real numbers, four-dimensional visualization, basic point-set topology, function spaces, multivariable calculus via differential forms (leading to a simple proof of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem), and a pictorial treatment of Lebesgue theory. Over 150 detailed illustrations elucidate abstract concepts and salient points in proofs. The exposition is informal and relaxed, with many helpful asides, examples, some jokes, and occasional comments from mathematicians, such as Littlewood, Dieudonn�, and Osserman. This book thus succeeds in being more comprehensive, more comprehensible, and more enjoyable, than standard introductions to analysis.<br><br>New to the second edition of <i>Real Mathematical Analysis</i> is a presentation of Lebesgue integration done almost entirely using the undergraph approach of Burkill. Payoffs include: concise picture proofs of the Monotone and Dominated Convergence Theorems, a one-line/one-picture proof of Fubini's theorem from Cavalieri&#x2019;s Principle, and, in many cases, the ability to <i>see</i> an integral result from measure theory. The presentation includes Vitali&#x2019;s Covering Lemma, density points &#x2015; which are rarely treated in books at this level &#x2015; and the almost everywhere differentiability of monotone functions. Several new exercises now join a collection of over 500 exercises that pose interesting challenges and introduce special topics to the student keen on mastering this beautiful subject.</p></p><p>Charles C.

Lingua Franca</p><h2>The Tyranny of Science</h2><p>Paul Feyerabend is one of the greatest philosophers of science of the 20th century and his book <i>Against Method</i> is an international bestseller. In this new book he masterfully weaves together the main elements of his mature philosophy into a gripping tale: the story of the rise of rationalism in Ancient Greece that eventually led to the entrenchment of a mythical &#x2018;scientific worldview&#x2019;.<br> <br> In this wide-ranging and accessible book Feyerabend challenges some modern myths about science, including the myth that &#x2018;science is successful&#x2019;. He argues that some very basic assumptions about science are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd<br> misconceptions about the nature of human life. Far from solving the pressing problems of our age, such as war and poverty, scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities, at the cost of confronting<br> the real particulars that make life meaningful. Objectivity and generality are based on abstraction, and as such, they come at a high price. For abstraction drives a wedge between our thoughts and our<br> experience, resulting in the degeneration of both. Theoreticians, as opposed to practitioners, tend to impose a tyranny on the concepts they use, abstracting away from the subjective experience that makes<br> life meaningful. Feyerabend concludes by arguing that practical experience is a better guide to reality than any theory, by itself, ever could be, and he stresses that there is no tyranny that cannot be resisted, even if it is exerted with the best possible intentions.<br> <br> Provocative and iconoclastic, <i>The Tyranny of Science</i> is one of Feyerabend&#x2019;s last books and one of his best. It will be widely read by everyone interested in the role that science has played, and continues to play, in the shaping of the modern world.</p><p>Paul Feyerabend was one of the twentieth century's leading philosophers of science. His most well-known books are <i>Against Method </i>and <i>Science in a Free Society</i>.<br>"The lectures are engaging, educative and entertaining - public lecturing at its best. Feyerabend offers an intriguing, entertaining and very original application of the history and philosophy of science to contemporary social, intellectual and public issues."<br> <i><b>British Journal for the History of Science</b></i><br> <br> "Each of the four lectures is excellent and interrelateswith the others. Feyerabend's appealing and evocative entrances to scientific ideological claims permeate, and their lucidity will make identification and extraction of key concepts readily possible for scholars."<br> <i><b>The</b> <b>Year's Work in Cultural and Critical Theory</b></i><br> <br> "Offers intrepid scholars much to go on (on the relationship between Wittgenstein and Feyerabend), as well as being an entertaining and vigorous philosophical exercise in itself."<br> <i><b>Philosophical Investigations</b></i><br> <br> "In this posthumously published book, the maverick philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend questions the dominance of abstract, theoretical, objectivist science over more human modes of thought."<br> <i><b>New Scientist<br> <br> </b></i>"Stimulating, thought-provoking, and hugely entertaining."<br> <i><b>Morning Star</b></i> <p>"Its clear conversational style makes the book a useful introduction to Feyerabend's thought."<br> <b><i>Claremont Review of Books</i></b> </p> <p>"Both the style of presentation, and the question and answer sessions, will make this book accessible to a popular readership. It will be met with enthusiasm by those with a prior engagement with Feyerabend&#x2019;s work."<br> <i><b>Metascience</b></i></p> <p>"Feyerabend is not attacking science but rather the ideology of science and the metaphysical pronouncements of philosophers and theoreticians. He makes an eloquent and imaginative plea for the importance of the diverse forms of knowledge embodied in the practicalities of everyday life."<br> <b>David Bloor, University of Edinburgh</b></p> <p>"<i>The Tyranny of Science</i> is no work of arid scholarship or technical philosophy. It is the work of a philosophical story-teller who recounts 'fairytales' to situate the ideas he discusses.

Herring's 2008 <em>From Colony to Superpower </em>has won wide acclaim from critics and readers alike. <em>Years of Peril and Ambition: U.S. Foreign Relations, 1776-1921</em> is the first volume of a new split paperback edition of that masterwork, making this award-winning title accessible to those with a particular interest in the first half of the United States' history. <br><br>This first volume of Herring's international narrative charts the rise of the United States from a loose grouping of British colonies huddled along the Atlantic coast of North America into an emerging world power at the end of World War I. It tells an epic story of restless settlers pushing against weak restraints; of explorers, sea captains, adventurers, merchants, and missionaries carrying American ways to new lands. It analyzes countless crises, some resulting in war and others resolved peacefully. Above all, it is the tale of United States' expansion, commercial and political, across the North American continent, into the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean regions, and, economically, worldwide. Herring brings this first segment of America's dramatic emergence as a superpower to a close with the United States' post-World War I rise to the status of the world's most powerful nation, poised -- however unsteadily --for global engagement in what would be called the American Century.<br><br><em>Years of Peril and Ambition</em> highlights the ongoing impact of the nation's international affairs on the household names of U.S. history but also on ordinary citizens. Featuring a grand cast of characters, encompassing statesmen and presidents, diplomats and foreigners, and rogues and rascals alike, this fast-paced account illuminates the central importance of foreign relations to the existence and survival of the nation.<br></p><p><br><strong>George C. Herring</strong> is Alumni Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Kentucky. A leading authority on U.S. foreign relations, he is the former editor of <em>Diplomatic History</em> and a past president of the <em>Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations</em>. He is the author of <em>America's</em> <em>Longest War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975</em> and <em>LBJ and Vietnam: A Different Kind of War</em>, among other books.<br><br>"The strength of this book is the author's Herculean power of synthesis...Herring recaptures a quarter-millennium of American foreign policy with fluidity and felicity...we have long been waiting for a single-volume history like this one, and "From Colony to Superpower" deserves a place on the bookshelf."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Its first achievement is its feat of inclusiveness, managed by making quick work of many interesting subplots of the United States' rich and complex relations with the world...The narrative power lies partly in identifying themes that gradually give a strong organizational cohesion to his story...It is revisionism of the best kind, quiet but insistent, reinforced by archival evidence and deftly drawn parallels."--Howard W. French, <em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"An impressive, up-to-date diplomatic history of the US that masterfully employs traditional, revisionnist, and in many instances synthetic interpretations in a story line from Colonial America to the second Bush administration.... This will be an award-winning book that becomes the standard text for US diplomatic history. A superb accomplishment. Essential."--C.W. Haury, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"The only volume in the series that spans the entirety of the American past, <em>From Colony to Superpower</em> could not be more timely, more colorful, or more compelling for Americans seeking to understand the causes and the consequences of the quagmires in Afghanistan and Iraq. Herring is well equipped to provide that analysis."--<em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em><p></p><br>"A sweeping and lucid history...This authoritative work is destined to grace the bookshelves not only of scholars, but also of nonspecialists who want to understand how the US has engaged the world from the American Revolution to the administration of George W. Bush."--<em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"A model of clarity."--<em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"This latest entry in the outstanding Oxford History of the United States is continually engrossing in its overview of American diplomacy... Herring's lucid prose and thought-provoking arguments give this large tome a pace that never flags."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> starred review<p></p><br>"The only themed volume so far in the 'Oxford History of the United States' series, this work portrays the history of the world's foremost republic through the prism of its international interactions. Striking is the emergence, through Herring's clear and compelling storytelling, of certain themes in the way the United States has conducted and still conducts itself among nations...Highly recommended for both public and academic libraries."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"A magisterial look at 232 years of diplomacy."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"Magisterial."--<em>National Interest</em><p></p><br>"A mammoth volume that tracks the vagaries of American foreign policy over more than two centuries. It is encyclopedic in its reach, but remains a pleasurable read. Herring's goal is more to explain than judge, and he performs the former with admirable skill."--<em>Global Research</em><p></p><br>"George Herring's colossal history of US foreign relations has earned fully-deserved praise for its staggering erudition, lucid prose and brisk style."--<em>The National</em><p></p><br>"Impeccably written and deeply researched."--<em>The Veteran: The Official Voice of Vietnam Veterans of America</em><p></p><br>"Riveting."--<em>The Post and Courier</em><p></p><br>"The purpose of this ambitious and massive work is to track and explain how 13 separate, vulnerable British colonies evolved to carve out a position of dominance in world affairs. This is the latest volume in the Oxford History of the United States series...Herring effectively dismisses the myth of American isolationism. Even before our Revolution, Americans had strong economic ties with several European powers, and our diplomatic efforts were essential in facilitating the westward movement. Herring also deftly deals with the often-conflicting strains of idealism and pragmatism that have motivated our policy makers. Patient and well-informed general readers will find this well worth the effort."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"In this splendidly detailed account, George Herring expertly guides us through the rich and fascinating story of America's foreign relations. This is history on a grand scale, clearly and elegantly rendered. Anyone who wants to understand how the United States has come to occupy its current place on the world stage should read this magisterial book."--Fredrik Logevall, co-author of <em>A People and a Nation</em><p></p><br>"Readers of his work knew that George Herring's review of U.S. foreign policy would be scrupulously fair-minded but may not have anticipated so broad a sweep and so deeply felt an analysis. In swift and highly readable prose, Professor Herring explains us unforgettably to ourselves."--A. J. Langguth, author of <em>Our Vietnam</em><p></p><br>"Authored by a distinguished historian of American foreign policy, this is a landmark work in its scope, clarity of writing, depth of research, and significant interpretations of, among others, the 'myth' of historic American isolationism, the revealing relationships between how Americans behave at home and how they behave abroad, a most bittersweet Cold War, and the centuries-long dependence of Americans on beliefs in their supposed exceptionalism and Manifest Destiny. It offers a most rewarding lesson about how the history of U.S. foreign policy is to be examined, if not always, given the policy's often tragic results, praised."--Walter LaFeber, Cornell University<p></p><br>"George Herring's well-paced, readable, and up-to-date history of U.S. foreign relations will be the authoritative account for this generation."--Emily S. Rosenberg, University of California, Irvine<p></p><br></p><h2>Poetry: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Poetry, arguably, has a greater range of conceptual meaning than perhaps any other term in English. At the most basic level everyone can recognize it--it is a kind of literature that uses special linguistic devices of organization and expression for aesthetic effect. However, far grander claims have been made for poetry than this -- such as Shelley's that the poets "are the unacknowledged legislators of the world," and that poetry is "a higher truth." <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Bernard O'Donoghue provides a fascinating look at the many different forms of writing which have been called "poetry" -- from the Greeks to the present day. As well as questioning what poetry <em>is</em>, he asks what poetry is <em>for</em>, and considers contemporary debates on its value. Is there a universality to poetry? And does it have a duty of public utility and responsibility? <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bernard O'Donoghue</strong> is an Emeritus Fellow of Wadham College, where he taught Medieval English and Modern Irish Poetry. Also a poet and a literary critic, his poetry collection <em>Gunpowder</em> (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1995) was awarded the 1995 Whitbread Poetry Award. He has authored and edited several titles, including <em>The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney</em> (CUP, 2008) and <em>Reading Chaucer's Poems: A Guided Selection</em> (Faber, 2015). In 2006, his translation of <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em> was published by Penguin.<br><br>"... achieves an air of indispensability, as both a guidebook for the enquiring beginner, and as a handbook of poetic values for the determined practitioner." - Simon Armitage <br><p></p><br>"Everyone near the beginning of their life in poetry will want to have this book, and everyone further down the track will value it as a stimulation." - Andrew Motion <br><p></p><br>"A bold encounter with the questions that make his subject so compelling" - Professor Stephen Regan, Durham University <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Blues: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>Praised as "suave, soulful, ebullient" (Tom Waits) and "a meticulous researcher, a graceful writer, and a committed contrarian" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>), Elijah Wald is one of the leading popular music critics of his generation. In <em>The Blues</em>, Wald surveys a genre at the heart of American culture. <br> It is not an easy thing to pin down. As Howlin' Wolf once described it, "When you ain't got no money and can't pay your house rent and can't buy you no food, you've damn sure got the blues." It has been defined by lyrical structure, or as a progression of chords, or as a set of practices reflecting West African "tonal and rhythmic approaches," using a five-note "blues scale." Wald sees blues less as a style than as a broad musical tradition within a constantly evolving pop culture. He traces its roots in work and praise songs, and shows how it was transformed by such professional performers as W. C. Handy, who first popularized the blues a century ago. He follows its evolution from Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith through Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix; identifies the impact of rural field recordings of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton and others; explores the role of blues in the development of both country music and jazz; and looks at the popular rhythm and blues trends of the 1940s and 1950s, from the uptown West Coast style of T-Bone Walker to the "down home" Chicago sound of Muddy Waters. Wald brings the story up to the present, touching on the effects of blues on American poetry, and its connection to modern styles such as rap.<br> As with all of Oxford's Very Short Introductions, <em>The Blues</em> tells you--with insight, clarity, and wit--everything you need to know to understand this quintessentially American musical genre.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elijah Wald</strong> is a musician who teaches blues history at UCLA. His books include <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll, Global Minstrels</em>, and <em>Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues. </em><br><br>"The most illuminating short treatment of the blues ever published."--Terry Teachout, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Both thorough and illuminating. . . . It would be impossible to pack more critical wisdom-or common sense-into a smaller, shapelier package."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Domains and Demands of School Social Work Practice: A Guide to Working Effectively with Students, Families and Schools (SSWAA Workshop Series)</h2><p>School social work enters its second century as a profession still conflicted about its central mission. Are school social workers meant to be "in-house" clinicians providing services to kids in need, or are they meant to be involved in program development to enhance the social and emotional learning of all students in a school? How much time should they devote to serving whole families, or consulting with teachers? Whatever school social workers claim to do in their schools, it's clear that they are going to have to prove that they are effective doing it. The demands of federal legislation like No Child Left Behind and state requirements for certification are making it increasingly necessary that school social workers demonstrate that they are highly qualified school-based mental health and social service professionals who can demonstrate outcomes that impact school "bottom line" issues like student achievement, attendance, and behavior. Rather than recoil from this pressure, school social workers can utilize the skills of evidence based practice (EBP) to help them enhance both their effectiveness and their knowledge of interventions that work to help students, teachers, parents, and staff in school contexts. A succinct SSWAA Workshop volume, <em>The Domains and Demands of School Social Work Practice</em> demonstrates how EBP can be integrated into school social worker's daily practice, advancing the debate about where social workers can and should intervene, and how to do so effectively. Highlighting primary clinical issues, family problems, and school-wide needs faced by school social workers, it helps practitioners make the best use of evidence to be flexible, effective advocates at all levels of practice.<br></p><p><br>"The book's effective organization, contemporary examples, and coherent procedures for executing EBP make it an exceptional read for any school social worker."--<em>School Social Work Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Construction Estimating Using Excel (What's New in Trades &amp; Technology)</h2><p><p> <i>For beginning to intermediate courses in construction estimating in two- and four-year construction management programs.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>A step-by-step, hands-on introduction to commercial and residential estimating</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Construction Estimating with Excel, 3/e, </i> </b>introduces readers to the fundamental principles of estimating using drawing sets, real-world exercises, and examples.

In the first account in English of this fascinating tradition, George M. Young offers a dynamic and wide-ranging examination of the lives and ideas of the Russian Cosmists.<br><br>Suppressed during the Soviet period and little noticed in the West, the ideas of the Cosmists have in recent decades been rediscovered and embraced by many Russian intellectuals and are now recognized as essential to a native Russian cultural and intellectual tradition. Although they were scientists, theologians, and philosophers, the Cosmists addressed topics traditionally confined to occult and esoteric literature. Major themes include the indefinite extension of the human life span to establish universal immortality; the restoration of life to the dead; the reconstitution of the human organism to enable future generations to live beyond earth; the regulation of nature to bring all manifestations of blind natural force under rational human control; the transition of our biosphere into a "noosphere," with a sheath of mental activity surrounding the planet; the effect of cosmic rays and currently unrecognized particles of energy on human history; practical steps toward the reversal and eventual human control over the flow of time; and the virtues of human androgyny, autotrophy, and invisibility.<br><br><em>The Russian Cosmists</em> is a crucial contribution to scholarship concerning Russian intellectual history, the future of technology, and the history of western esotericism.<br></p><p><br><strong>George M. Young is a Fellow at The Center for Global Humanities at the University of New England.</strong><br><br>"a fascinating, mind expanding, highly informative magical mystery tour of a distinctive school of New Age thinking." -- ew York Journal of Books<p></p><br>"The Cosmists were a peculiarly Russian group: they were all very Russian, and they were also, frankly, peculiar. In <em>The Russian Cosmists</em>, George M. Young charts in detail the influences that shaped an unusual coterie of thinkers, and explores how the mystical and scientific offspring of this movement to conquer death and traverse the cosmos have reverberated from the late nineteenth century to the dawn of the twenty-first."--Michael D. Gordin, Professor of History, Princeton University<p></p><br>"George Young has given us a gift in this well-written and utterly engaging view of Russian Cosmist theories and their connections to the history of Western Esoteric thought. The book opens a doorway into another way of thinking that both challenges and expands contemporary perspectives on esotericism, magic, cosmology and 'active' evolutionary theory. The remarkable fact is that little of this material is recognized within the general history of esotericism and the Russian Cosmist perspective adds tremendous nuance and alterity to current paradigms. Not only is this a sweeping historical survey, it also offers a rich selection of primary sources, citations, and persons that demonstrate the unique conceptual scientific and mystical frame for much Cosmist esoteric speculation. In terms of Russian esotericism, it is a unique and rare publication and deserves careful study and assimilation.

In this new paperback edition of <em>Gospel-Centered Hermeneutics</em>, Goldsworthy moves beyond a reiteration of the usual arguments to concentrate on the theological questions of presuppositions, and the implications of the Christian gospel for hermeneutics. In doing so, he brings fresh perspectives on some well-worn pathways. Part I examines the foundations and presuppositions of evangelical belief, particularly with regard to biblical interpretation. Part II offers a selective overview of important hermeneutical developments from the sub-apostolic age to the present, as a means of identifying some significant influences that have been alien to the gospel. Part III evaluates ways and means of reconstructing truly gospel-centered hermeneutics. Goldsworthy's aim throughout is to commend the much-neglected role of biblical theology in hermeneutical practice, with pastoral concern for the people of God as they read, interpret and seek to live by his written Word.</p><p><strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong> now retired, was formerly lecturer in Old Testament, biblical theology and hermeneutics at Moore Theological College, Sydney, where he still teaches part-time."The message is a potent call to evangelicals <em>to be</em> evangelical in their hermeneutics. <em>Gospel-Centered Hermeneutics</em> will prove a useful tool for Bible students and pastors." (Michael J. Thate, Bulletin for Biblical Research, vol. 19, no. 1, 2009)<br><br>"Goldsworthy demonstrates the need for a robust biblical theological method that exalts Jesus, which is exactly what his book does." (Andrew David Naselli, JETS, June 2008)<br><br>"Amongst a spate of hermeneutics books, why should this one receive special consideration by readers interested in the subject? The first reason is the author. Graeme Goldsworthy has contributed numerous years in the classroom and multiple volumes in print to help the world understand the Bible better. The second reason why this book should receive special attention is because it offers so very clearly a general hermeneutics textbook from a well honed 'gospel-centered' approach. His summaries, bullet points, and analyses make this quite a usable text and a welcome contribution." (Matthew Cook, Evangelical Review of Theology, July 2008)<br><br>"This book is clearly written by an evangelical for evangelicals. Goldsworthy does present some helpful and balanced suggestions for hermeneutics, particularly when he writes of the need to do hermeneutics in the context of biblical theology as a whole." (Wilburn T. Stanch, Catholic Book Reviews, January 2008)<br><br>"The book is stellar in focusing on Christ as the hermeneutic of Scripture and reality. . . . It is a challenging and worthwhile read for the serious student." (Doug Smith, SharperIron.org, February 20, 2008)<br><br>"One of the more significant books of the year." (Preaching, November/December 2007)<br><br>"Goldsworthy articulates how we should interpret the whole Bible in light of the gospel. This is a readable book that is concerned first and foremost with the pastoral situation." (Preaching, Bible and Reference Survey 2007)<br><br>"This book was written to be a textbook, and will make a good one. It almost shouts 'I'm a ready-made syllabus!'" (Rich Ritchie, Modern Reformation, May/June 2007)<br><br>"<em>Gospel-Centered Hermeneutics</em> is a clarion call for those who <em>believe</em> that the Bible is the word of God to <em>interpret</em> it like it is the word of God. It is chock full of insights useful to any thoughtful believer who wants to be able to read his or her Bible <em>Christianly.</em> Goldsworthy is to be particularly commended for his clear demonstration that a robust and believing biblical theology provides a solid foundation for knowing how to approach the Bible." (Mark Traphage, League of Inveterate Poets, foolishsage.com, 2007)<br><br>"Not a book best handled with casual reading. Rather, it is the type of book that must be approached with a certain level of hermeneutical angst and a willingness to perceive one's own hermeneutical shortcomings. It is also the type of book that should be read more than once, perhaps annually for a decade or so."

Zak Ebrahim was only seven years old when, on November 5th, 1990, his father El-Sayyid Nosair shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defense League. While in prison, Nosair helped plan the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. In one of his infamous video messages, Osama bin Laden urged the world to &#x201c;Remember El-Sayyid Nosair.&#x201d;<br> <br>For Zak Ebrahim, a childhood amongst terrorism was all he knew. After his father&#x2019;s incarceration, his family moved often, and as the perpetual new kid in class, he faced constant teasing and exclusion. Yet, though his radicalized father and uncles modeled fanatical beliefs, to Ebrahim something never felt right. To the shy, awkward boy, something about the hateful feelings just felt unnatural.<br> <br>In this book, Ebrahim dispels the myth that terrorism is a foregone conclusion for people trained to hate. Based on his own remarkable journey, he shows that hate is always a choice&#x2014;but so is tolerance. Though Ebrahim was subjected to a violent, intolerant ideology throughout his childhood, he did not become radicalized. Ebrahim argues that people conditioned to be terrorists are actually well positioned to combat terrorism, because of their ability to bring seemingly incompatible ideologies together in conversation and advocate in the fight for peace. Ebrahim argues that everyone, regardless of their upbringing or circumstances, can learn to tap into their inherent empathy and embrace tolerance over hatred. His original, urgent message is fresh, groundbreaking, and essential to the current discussion about terrorism.</p><p>Zak Ebrahim was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on March 24, 1983, the son of an Egyptian industrial engineer and an American school teacher. When Ebrahim was seven, his father shot and killed the founder of the Jewish Defense League, Rabbi Meir Kahane. From behind bars his father, El-Sayyid Nosair, co-masterminded the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Ebrahim spent the rest of his childhood moving from city to city, hiding his identity from those who knew of his father. He now dedicates his life to speaking out against terrorism and spreading his message of peace and nonviolence."Ebrahim&#x2019;s life is an eloquent plea to terrorists &#x2014; indeed, to anyone who commits violence out of bigotry and hatred &#x2014; to stop and consider the impact on children. His tale speaks to the suffering of children everywhere &#x2014; in Gaza, Israel, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria &#x2014; who are caught up in the raging intolerance of adults. In emotional detail, the terrorist&#x2019;s son takes us through the traumas of his life &#x2014; school bullying, social withdrawal, feelings of suicidal worthlessness &#x2014; that dogged him from the moment his mother awakened the boy in his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pajamas to inform him that something was horribly wrong and they had to flee immediately from their home in Cliffside Park, N.J.", <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>"[A] book you can't put down. Hearing the story of Zak Ebrahim&#x2014;the son of El-Sayyid Nosair who, when Ebrahim was just 7 years old, killed the leader of the Jewish Defense League and went on to plan the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center from prison&#x2014;is one thing. (A gut-wrenching, <i>how-is-this-real-life</i>? thing.) Reading it in intimate, terrifying detail&#x2014;the confusion, the bullying, the burden&#x2014;is another.

Instead of following in those violent footsteps, Ebrahim now speaks out against terrorism. An astonishing memoir.", <i>People</i></p><h2>The Irish Soldiers of Mexico</h2><p>The Irish Soldiers of Mexico sold out fourteen editions in English and three editions in Spanish from 1997 to 2010. It has been the basis of an MGM feature film and two documentaries; it has also been used in many history classes both in the United States and abroad. This revised edition includes new historical material such as the location of what is purported to be a death certificate for John Riley located in a church in Veracruz and evidence that appears to negate its value. The edition also includes updated &#x201c;After the War&#x201d; and &#x201c;Commemorations&#x201d; sections. Many positive changes in public perception of the San Patricios have taken place since the first publication of this book in 1997. In addition, there have been a number of new vehicles for dissemination of the history, not the least of which was the production of &#x201c;One Man&#x2019;s Hero,&#x201d; starring Tom Berenger, three novels on the San Patiricios, a new sculpture in Mexico City of John Riley donated by the people of Ireland, and the Chieftains CD with songs commemorating the Irish battalion.</p><p></p><h2>Theories of the Chakras : Bridge to Higher Consciousness</h2><p>It is an outstanding book from both the scientific and spiritual points of view. It is the unique record of the pioneering experiments which presents clear, electro-physiological evidence of the existence of the network of chakras and nadis which form the infra-structure of the subtle energies existing in the pranic and psychic dimensions, which underlie and activate the physical, material body of man. The experiments in the book successfully integrate the subjective and objective dimensions of knowledge, and will serve as guideposts and blueprints for experiments in the years ahead. The chakras and other components of the human energy field were largely brought to the attention of the Western world by clairvoyant Charles W. Lead beater. His pioneering work is discussed in detail in this fascinating exploration of the subtle body, along with that of other respected seers and yogis.</p><p>DR. HIROSHI MOTOYAMA Holds doctorates in psychology and philosophy. He founded the institute for Religion and Psychology and is author of over twenty books, including Karma and Reincarnation and Toward a Super consciousness : Meditational Theory and Practice.This book represents a monumental effort to review and correlate much of the accumulated knowledge of the subtle energy systems...Such a book could only be written by a person who has had the life-long personal experiences which Dr. Motoyama so generous shares with the reader. These experiences provide step-by-step illustration of unfolding and expanding consciousness. The book is necessary reading for all serious students of the subject of consciousness. --George W. Meek</p><h2>A Cry for Justice: How the Evil of Domestic Abuse Hides in Your Church</h2><p>Abuse in the Church of Jesus Christ!<br><br>In many Christian circles this may be a taboo subject--spoken of in hushed tones or behind closed doors. But it is a very real problem that must be brought into the light of Scripture.<br><br>Abuse in the church takes different forms; but it is alive and active even in "nice" families in our churches. Typically, the abuser is male, usually a husband--and his character is that of a manipulating deceiver.&nbsp;Countless women and children--even many faithful pastors--have been abused by these deceivers.<br><br>Have you, or someone you know, been a victim? Has an abuser:<br><br>* Threatened physical violence if he does not get his way?<br><br>* Intimidated with abusive language?<br><br>* Denied affection?<br><br>* Denied you medical attention?<br><br>* Manipulated friends and acquaintances in order to gain allies?<br><br>Pastor Jeff Crippen uses his over thirty years of pastoral experience to rip the lid off this most insidious behavior that is often "hidden in plain sight." He not only maintains that Bible-believing churches have ignored or failed to face the problem, he insists that when they do counsel a victim of abuse, they get it all wrong. What happens is that the victim gets pulled into deeper--even life threatening--danger.<br><br>This book will come as a life saver in a raging sea for those under the thumb of an abusive spouse or "friend."&nbsp;The Lord Jesus Christ wants you to be free in Him: Spiritually, emotionally and, yes, physically (i.e.; away from your oppressor).<br><br>Pastors will benefit from reading this book, sometimes because they also have been victims, but more importantly, so that they can properly counsel those caught in a cycle of abuse.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;See also the author's book&nbsp;<i>Unholy Charade: Unmasking the Domestic Abuser in the Church,&nbsp;</i>which presents similar material but updated with Jeff Crippen's three more years of understanding of domestic abuse, and packed full of first-person accounts from those who have had to live through it.

These included rabid warriors like defrocked military general Edwin A. Walker; the world's richest oil baron, H. L. Hunt; the leader of the largest Baptist congregation in the world, W.A. Criswell; and the media mogul Ted Dealey, who raucously confronted JFK and whose family name adorns the plaza where the president was murdered. On the same stage was a compelling cast of marauding gangsters, swashbuckling politicos, unsung civil rights heroes, and a stylish millionaire anxious to save his doomed city.<br><br>Bill Minutaglio and Steven L. Davis ingeniously explore the swirling forces that led many people to warn President Kennedy to avoid Dallas on his fateful trip to Texas. Breathtakingly paced, DALLAS 1963 presents a clear, cinematic, and revelatory look at the shocking tragedy that transformed America. Countless authors have attempted to explain the assassination, but no one has ever bothered to explain Dallas-until now.<br><br>With spellbinding storytelling, Minutaglio and Davis lead us through intimate glimpses of the Kennedy family and the machinations of the Kennedy White House, to the obsessed men in Dallas who concocted the climate of hatred that led many to blame the city for the president's death. Here at long last is an accurate understanding of what happened in the weeks and months leading to John F. Kennedy's assassination. DALLAS 1963 is not only a fresh look at a momentous national tragedy but a sobering reminder of how radical, polarizing ideologies can poison a city-and a nation.</p><p><b>Bill Minutaglio</b> has been published in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Texas Monthly</i>, and the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>.

By exposing the hatred aimed at our 35th president, the authors demonstrates that America--not just Lee Harvey Oswald--was ultimately responsible for his death. Every page is an eye opener. Highly recommended!"&#x2015;<b><i>Douglas Brinkley, professor of history at Rice University and author of <i>Cronkite</i></i></b><br><br>"All the great personalities of Dallas during the assassination come alive in this superb rendering of a city on a roller coaster into disaster.

Skyscrapers have been piercing the clouds since the end of the nineteenth century but today's soaring land prices are driving developers to build bigger, better and higher while aiming for as small a footprint as possible. </p><p> The lavish spreads feature a large photograph with cross-section drawings plus fact boxes listing location, year of completion, height, stories, primary functions, owner/developer, architect, structural engineer, and construction firm. </p><p> Concise text describes historical context; unusual or innovative construction; engineering and structural systems; foundation, facade, and shape; the site history; and building usage; as well as any special features that make the skyscraper unique. For example, "The Gherkin" at 30 St Mary Axe, London, UK, surprisingly has only one piece of curved glass, despite its rounded shape. </p><p> The 46 skyscrapers in <i>How to Build a Skyscraper</i> appear not for their height but for their pioneering technology, sustainability, and other characteristics that set them apart. They are distributed over the world's most developed regions of North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. </p><p> Some of the skyscrapers are: </p><ul> <li> New York City's One World Trade Center next to the site of the two World Trade towers and still known by many people as the Freedom Tower. </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> The Kingdom Center, with a hole and skybridge at its top and interiors that call to mind the spaceships of Hollywood, the third tallest skyscraper in Saudi Arabia.</li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Bangkok's "Elephant Tower", properly the Chang Building, honoring Thailand's national animal but noted most for its place on "worst building" lists. </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> The iconic Shanghai Tower, sculpted for efficiency, reduced costs, and environmental benefit by virtue of its curvilinear form and 120-degree twist. </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> The Bank of China in Hong Kong, designed by I. M. Pei, controversial because it was built without the benefit of a feng shui consultation. </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> The Taipei Tower in Taiwan, the world's most environmentally responsible skyscraper in reduced water use, energy use, and carbon emissions, and also designed to withstand typhoon winds and earthquake tremors. </li></ul> <p></p><p> <i>How to Build a Skyscraper</i> also features height comparison graphics of all featured skyscrapers on the inside front and back covers. </p></p><p><p> John Hill is a registered architect, editor-in-chief of the Daily News section of World-Architects.com (over 100k monthly visitors) and founder and editor-in-chief of the blog A Daily Dose of Architecture (www.archidose.org).

The choice of buildings includes those with particularly ambitious design and awe-inspiring architectural detailing, ranging from older buildings, such as the Chrysler and Empire State buildings, to newer buildings, such as One World Trade Center and the Shanghai Tower. The two-four page entries for each building include such information as historical background, information about the people involved (the architects and the owners), basic and detailed design information, comparison to similar buildings, materials used, site location, etc. Color illustrations, some with cut-away views of certain cross-sections, provide interesting details.

Handsome color photographs, fact-packed summaries and crisp drawings (especially, a lucid cutaway look at each skyscraper) enhance his bite-sized blocks of text... This book stays true to its title, probing beneath the skin of skyscrapers to reveal their structural bones and the other things that shape them.

(Marcus Warner, president, Deeper Walk International)<br><br>"Scott McElroy brings a thoroughly biblical worldview to his treatment of the arts as one of the ways we can enhance worship and ministry in the church. Theological education has often become so intellectual in its approach to the mission of the church that the intimacy of personal relationship is missed in the process. McElroy sees the proper use of the arts as another way of expressing an intimate personal relationship in the definition of mature discipleship. All of this with a wealth of practical suggestions and resources." (Timothy M.

(Byron Spradlin, president, Artists in Christian Testimony International)<br><br>"Scott shapes his thesis of why creativity needs to be brought back into the church, like a master craftsman, chipping away the old paint to let the true grain of the wood's beauty be revealed. God wants the church to be creative because he is creative. Scott offers practical insights for every church and believer to begin to incorporate the arts into their church and vision for their community. I highly recommend this as a practical guide with lots of wisdom for those who are hungry to be relevant to where we are headed in the life of the church&#x2015;a must read."

He almost desperately wished to publish his early stories in The New Yorker magazine, the pinnacle, he felt, of America&#39;s literary world. But such was not to be for several long years and the length of one long world war. The New Yorker, whose tastes in literary matters were and remain notoriously prim and fickle, was not quite ready for this brash and over-confident newcomer with the cynical worldview and his habit of slangy dialogue. But other magazines were quick to recognize a new talent, a fresh voice at a time when the world verged on madness. Story magazine, an esteemed and influential small circulation journal devoted exclusively to the art of the short story and still active and respected today, was the first publication to publish the name J.D. Salinger and the story &#34;The Young Folks&#34; in 1940, an impressive view of New York&#39;s cocktail society and two young people talking past one another, their conversation almost completely meaningless and empty. His next short story was published in a college journal, The University of Kansas City Review, &#34;Go See Eddie,&#34; a tale of quiet menace as an unsavory male character gradually turns up the pressure on a young lady to see a man named Eddie. Also published in 1940, the story is notable for the backstory that is omitted - a technique that Hemingway used to great effect. Four years later toward the end of Salinger&#39;s war experience saw the publication of &#34;Once A Week Won&#39;t Kill You,&#34; again in Story magazine. Ostensibly about a newly minted soldier trying to tell an aging aunt he is going off to war, some may see the story as a metaphor for preparing one&#39;s family for the possibility of wartime death. Three Early Stories (Illustrated) is the first legitimately published book by J.D. Salinger in more than 50 years.

He was awarded four Pulitzer Prizes and the Congressional Gold Medal for his poetry.<br><br><b>David Orr&nbsp;</b>is the poetry columnist for the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. He is the winner of the Nona Balakian Prize from the National Book Critics Circle and his writing has appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and the <i>Yale Review</i>.<p>Introduction</p><p>In the later stages of his strange, illustrious, and very long career, Robert Frost was often talked about as if he were two different poets, or possibly even two different people&#x2014;a phenomenon that continues even now, half a century after his death in 1963. The first poet is the familiar New England icon, the salty, no-nonsense dispenser of rustic wisdom whose lines have the sturdiness and warmth of hearthstones knelt upon by generations of yeoman farmers. This Frost is the Robert Frost of the common reader, the Frost of birches and fields and snow and spring pools. He writes plain poems that make plain sense, or seem to. Those poems often rhyme, and when they do, they do so forthrightly (<i>deep</i> and <i>sleep</i>, for instance). They&#x2019;re frequently about the quotidian lives of farmers, day laborers, mill workers, and other small-time folk at the beginning of the twentieth century. Their stanzas slat tidily together, like the corners of log cabins, and their most memorable lines are the sort of homely epigrams you might find crocheted on throw pillows: &#x201c;I took the one less traveled by&#x201d;; &#x201c;Good fences make good neighbours&#x201d;; &#x201c;But all the fun&#x2019;s in how you say a thing.&#x201d; This Robert Frost feels a bit old-fashioned, maybe, but in the way that George Washington seems old-fashioned, or pilgrim hats on Thanksgiving. He&#x2019;s part of the bedrock of the American identity.</p><p>The second Frost&#x2014;&#x201c;the other Frost,&#x201d; as Randall Jarrell described him in 1953&#x2014;is nearly the opposite of the first. This Frost is dark, manipulative, and withholding. His poems are often about madness or violence, and their seemingly stable surfaces are sheets of ice through which the unwitting traveler can easily plunge into frigid water. This Frost was no provincial farmer-poet, but rather a ruthlessly competitive and immensely erudite artist who was far more widely traveled than peers often considered more cosmopolitan, like Wallace Stevens. This Frost is the Frost of the sophisticated reader and, more specifically, the academic reader. Understanding this Robert Frost usually entails rejecting the first Frost as a pretense (&#x201c;the great act,&#x201d; as Robert Lowell once labeled it). It often means rejecting the audience who believes in that act as well. As the critic Lionel Trilling put it in a birthday salute to Frost in 1959, &#x201c;I have undertaken to say that a great many of your admirers have not understood clearly what you have been doing in your life in poetry.&#x201d; If the first Frost resembles one of the great carved heads of Mount Rushmore&#x2014;half monument, half kitsch, and accessible to anyone willing to pay for parking&#x2014;the second Frost often seems more like the surrounding badlands, where only a fool travels without a guide. And between these two possibilities is an obscuring, dust-filled haze.</p><p>It&#x2019;s tempting to say that the truth must lie hidden somewhere in the middle of that uncertain divide. If Frost isn&#x2019;t really a gruff but good-natured national bard, then surely it&#x2019;s equally wrong to try to turn him into a cold-eyed aesthete. The actual poet must be some blend of the two. But rather than wondering who or what Robert Frost really was, it&#x2019;s more interesting to wonder why his identity seems to matter in the first place. Few readers, for example, worry over whether Ezra Pound was &#x201c;really&#x201d; something entirely different from the Ezra Pound one reads about in the introduction to, say, <i>Early Writings </i>(Penguin Classics, 2005). The same goes for T. S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams&#x2014;all of Frost&#x2019;s renowned peers. Why do we care where the essence of Frost truly resides, and whom that essence was truly for?</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>The answer to this question is complex. But one aspect of it is simple: Frost became a public figure in a way no other American poet has managed, or even come close to managing. His goodwill was courted not just by scholars and other writers but by presidents and senators. He routinely spent the night at Eisenhower&#x2019;s White House; he was good friends with Stewart Udall, John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s secretary of the interior; and he was sent to the Soviet Union by Kennedy himself, where he spoke at length and privately with Nikita Khrushchev. (To appreciate how extraordinary this was, try to imagine a contemporary American poet being directed to Russia by President Obama and securing a t�te-�-t�te with Vladimir Putin.) Readers bought his works in numbers that would today be respectable for a fairly popular novelist, but that for a poet in the first half of the twentieth century were well beyond staggering. By the time his <i>Complete Poems</i> was issued in 1949, more than four hundred thousand of his books had been sold. That same year, a copy of Frost&#x2019;s first, privately printed collection was auctioned for the equivalent of thirty thousand dollars in today&#x2019;s currency, &#x201c;a price thought to be the highest paid for a work by a contemporary American author,&#x201d; according to the<i> New York Times</i>. When he died, his obituary ran on the front page of the<i> Times</i>, and included this tribute from Kennedy: &#x201c;I think politicians and poets share at least one thing, and that is their greatness depends upon the courage with which they face the challenges of life.&#x201d; Since Frost&#x2019;s death, his legacy has practically become a national resource, and like any resource, it tempts people to seize pieces of it for themselves. Given that, it&#x2019;s probably not surprising that there have come to be multiple versions of Frost. When we want to lay claim to something, we put forward the image that seems most favorable for our possession.</p><p>Of course, at the beginning there were no images at all, only the very young Robert Frost&#x2014;Robert <i>Lee</i> Frost, actually, for the Confederate general. That middle name may seem odd for a poet who would come to be so closely identified with New England, but in fact, most of Frost&#x2019;s early life had very little to do with the Yankee farming milieu he later embodied. He was born in San Francisco in 1874, the son of a firebrand newspaperman (and Robert E. Lee admirer) and a shy Swedenborgian schoolteacher. Frost didn&#x2019;t set foot on the soil of New England until he was eleven years old, when the death of his father forced his mother to turn to the support of her in-laws in Massachusetts. The family eventually settled in Salem Depot, New Hampshire, where Frost quickly distinguished himself as an excellent student, particularly in the classics, and a hard-charging athlete.</p><p>Frost&#x2019;s formative years were dominated by two overriding and entwined passions. The first, as one might expect, was for poetry, which he appears to have begun writing around age sixteen (his earliest known poem is about a Spanish retreat during the conquest of Mexico). The second was for Elinor White, with whom he shared valedictory honors in his high school class. Their courtship was turbulent. Frost wanted to be married right away, but Elinor put him off; she wanted to finish college, and she also wanted Frost to secure some means of support. Frost&#x2019;s own relationship with higher education was ambivalent at best, despite his intense interest in philosophy and literature. He entered Dartmouth in the fall of 1892, but he dropped out after less than a year, lonely and impatient with the regimented nature of university instruction, and returned to courting Elinor. When his first published poem, &#x201c;My Butterfly,&#x201d; was accepted by one of New York&#x2019;s weekly magazines, he took this as an occasion to press his suit. He had a small book of five poems printed up and traveled to Elinor&#x2019;s college in order to deliver it by hand. When this failed to bring about the anticipated swoon, Frost fled to a swamp on the Virginia&#x2013;North Carolina border, where he wandered around in a fit of extravagant despair until rescued by a group of duck hunters. Upon returning, he devoted himself again to Elinor, this time a bit more calmly, and they were finally married in December of 1895. Frost was twenty-one.</p><p>The next fifteen years would include a series of moves across New England, the death of Frost&#x2019;s mother, the loss of two of the couple&#x2019;s six children (their first child died from cholera; their sixth lived only three days), and a parade of temporary jobs for Frost: reporter, teacher, tutor, chicken farmer of questionable distinction. (Much of Frost&#x2019;s writing from this period appeared in magazines like <i>The Eastern Poultryman</i> and <i>Farm-Poultry</i>.) Through all of it, Frost wrote poetry with relentless focus, even though his efforts were routinely rejected by leading editors in New York and Boston. Left with little to go on but his own nerve, he developed a sense of self-reliance that was as unrepentant as it was unforgiving. In &#x201c;Into My Own,&#x201d; the first poem in his first book, he writes of setting out alone into a limitless, primeval forest:</p><p>I do not see why I should e&#x2019;er turn back,</p><p>Or those should not set forth upon my track</p><p>To overtake me, who should miss me here</p><p>And long to know if still I held them dear.</p><p>They would not find me changed from him they knew&#x2014;</p><p>Only more sure of all I thought was true.</p><p>One sees here the vestiges of Victorianism (<i>e&#x2019;er</i>) that Frost would soon discard, as well as the confident, conversational meter that would eventually make his poems unmistakable, and in many cases unforgettable. Despite his setbacks, he was sure of the worth of his writing. In 1912, with the assistance of a legacy from Frost&#x2019;s grandfather (whose support he had grudgingly relied on for years), he and Elinor decided to move to England in a last-ditch attempt to ignite the literary career that had thus far thrown off only a few quickly extinguished sparks.</p><p>The move was a spectacular success. Frost quickly met many of the leading poets circling London&#x2014;among them F. S. Flint and the ubiquitous Ezra Pound&#x2014;and within a year, he had placed his first book with a British publisher. But the most important contact that Frost made in his time in England was with the journalist (and later poet) Edward Thomas. Thomas almost immediately recognized the significance of Frost&#x2019;s poetry, and his early reviews were essential in establishing the terms by which Frost would be discussed on both sides of the Atlantic. He remains one of Frost&#x2019;s finest critics. Here is what he said about Frost in July of 1914:</p><p>This is one of the most revolutionary books of modern times, but one of the quietest and least aggressive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These poems are revolutionary because they lack the exaggeration of rhetoric, and even at first sight appear to lack the poetic intensity of which rhetoric is an imitation. Their language is free from the poetical words and forms that are the chief material of secondary poets. The metre avoids not only the old-fashioned pomp and sweetness, but the later fashion also of discord and fuss. In fact, the medium is common speech.</p><p>As Thomas understood, there is a kind of easy naturalness to Frost&#x2019;s writing that mimics ordinary talk, and that achieves a similarly vast range of effects and tones. The two writers soon became close friends, with Thomas providing Frost the responsive, companionable intelligence he&#x2019;d longed for, and Frost giving Thomas the encouragement to write his own (very good) poetry.</p><p>Frost and his family returned from England in 1915, just ahead of German U-boats. Recognition in England had landed Frost an American publisher, and upon arriving in New York, he was greeted with a glowing review of his second book, <i>North of Boston</i>, by Amy Lowell in <i>The</i> <i>New Republic</i>. (Frost&#x2019;s first two books were published in reverse order in the United States, with <i>North of Boston</i> appearing two months before <i>A Boy&#x2019;s Will</i>.) If Frost&#x2019;s early years were lonely and unrewarding, at least in professional terms, his literary life after his return to America was practically charmed: within two years, he had accepted a lucrative position at Amherst (one of many university appointments he would eventually hold); within nine years, he had won the Pulitzer Prize, the first of four he would be awarded. He was hugely in demand as a lecturer and reader, and began to develop the persona that would become his trademark. Jay Parini, Frost&#x2019;s most judicious biographer, describes that role as &#x201c;the slow-talking, witty, wisecracking, rueful, commonsensical, quasi-philosophical man of letters&#x2014;a carefully composed mask no less artful than those constructed by Oscar Wilde or Mark Twain before him.&#x201d; He seemed half sage, half farmer, and audiences loved him.</p><p>Politicians loved him too. As I said, no American poet before or since has occupied such a prominent place in the political life of the United States. Frost&#x2019;s private existence became increasingly dark over the years&#x2014;Elinor died, his son Carol committed suicide, and his daughter Irma became increasingly unstable (he eventually committed her to an asylum). But his public life was lived in unremitting sunlight. When he turned seventy-five, the Senate passed a resolution congratulating him for &#x201c;setting forth to our minds a reliable representation of ourselves and all men&#x201d;; when he turned eighty-five, the same body gave him a gold medal. Shortly after his death in 1963 at age eighty-eight, President Kennedy spoke at the dedication of the Robert Frost Library at Amherst. He called the poet &#x201c;one of the granite figures of our time,&#x201d; adding, &#x201c;He was supremely two things: an artist and an American.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Stages of the Soul: God&#39;s Invitation to Greater Love</h2><p><p><i>How can you tell if you&#x2019;re actually growing?</i></p><p>Sure, when you&#x2019;re working on getting rid of a huge character flaw you can see progress, but do you ever wish you had a roadmap for the spiritual journey for the rest of the time?

When combined, their independent visual voices show an unprecedented collection of Paris images. Unique views of the city's famous landmarks like the Sacr�-Coeur, the Louvre Museum, and the Eiffel Tower reveal an evocative city portrait. Lively areas overflowing with art and fashion, as well as lesser-known impressions of the city's banlieues, are all captured with a present-day attention to detail and a wide-eyed love for "la Ville Lumi�re."<br><br></p><p></p><h2>The Word of God in English: Criteria for Excellence in Bible Translation</h2><p><p>With so many Bible translations available, how do you make a choice between them? How do you even know what the criteria should be for making a choice?</p><p>As an expert in English literature and literary theory, Leland Ryken approaches the translation debate from a practical artistic viewpoint. He believes that many modern translations take liberties with the biblical text that would not be allowed with any other type of literary work. Also, what readers are presented with as biblical text is actually far from the original text. In literature, a simplified version of Milton's work is not Milton, and neither is an edition written in contemporary English. Anyone who is interested in Milton would find any version that changes his words unacceptable for serious study. Ryken argues that the same dedication to reproducing literature texts as closely as possible needs to be present in biblical translation. To do so it is necessary to take into account the difficulty of working with original languages. Only an essentially literal, "word for word" translation of the Bible can achieve sufficiently high standards in terms of literary criteria and fidelity to the original text.</p><p>Ryken does not contest that many modern translations have been used for good, and believes that there is a place for a range of Bible translations, including children's Bibles and Bible paraphrases. His purpose is not to say that the only Bible available should be one that is essentially literal. Instead, he defines the translation theory and principles that would result in the best Bible for English-speaking people and serious students of the Bible, and also for the English-speaking church as a whole. He believes that an essentially literal translation is the natural result of following these principles.</p><p>Along with a short history of translation, Ryken evaluates presuppositions that impact translation theory. He also examines fallacies about the Bible, translations in general, and Bible readers that influence what translation decisions are made. Believing that those who undertake the serious work of translating God's Word have an obligation both to God and to others, he assesses the theological, ethical, and hermeneutical issues involved and surveys difficulties with modern translations. Ryken's literary expertise gives him the perspective needed to provide Christians with a standard for comparing contemporary Bible translations, as well as an understanding of why some translations may not convey the very words of God.</p></p><p><p><strong>Leland Ryken</strong> (PhD, University of Oregon) served as professor of English at Wheaton College for nearly 50 years.

Academic bias and erasure has misrepresented these facts for over 120 years, to the point that few dare question today. Scientist James DeMeo reviews the original documents and archives, exposing the facts which demolish nearly all of the post-ether astrophysical theories, including Einstein's relativity, the "big bang", "black holes" and quantum magic. Cosmic ether exists and moves in a creative gravitational spiral vortex, as the long-sought prime mover and life-energy. A must-read item for the professional scientist, educated layperson and student, in ordinary language with minimal maths.&nbsp; For example:</p><p>Part I, Cosmic Ether as Theory and Experimentally Confirmed Fact, includes 8 different chapters which firstly introduces the concept of ether, then details the late 18th and 19th Century experimenters who made its detection by increasingly sophisticated instruments. The interferometer experiments of Dayton Miller are introduced, exposing facts by direct quotations from their publications in mainstream science journals, of multiple positive detections of the ether.&nbsp; In most every case, from the early to the more recent ether-drift experiments, the cosmic axis of Earth's motion in space, in right ascension and declination were in close agreement with the Sun's motion through the galaxy, towards the star Vega.&nbsp; These experiments provide evidence violating a major starting assumption for Einstein's theory of relativity, showing that <em>light speed is variable, depending upon direction in the cosmos. </em></p><p>Part II, The Empire Strikes Back: Erasure, Mystification and Falsification of History, covers the rise of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, and how he and his supporters managed to obscure and ignore the positive outcomes of the various ether-drift experiments. It also details the unethical "hatchet-job" against Dayton Miller's ether research, years after his death, by Einstein sycophant Robert Shankland, whose paper is still cited today as "definitive proof against Miller's ether-drift findings".&nbsp; That, it most certainly was not! Einstein's originally friendly, but later dismissive treatment of Miller is detailed, including his statements in private letters wherein he expressed deep concern that, if Miller's work was correct, then his theory of relativity would "collapse like a house of cards".</p><p>Part III, Into New Territory: Additional Evidence for a Material, Motional and Dynamic Ether, I overview findings from different disciplines, for a biologically-active and water-reactive cosmic life-energy.&nbsp; These findings are very agreeable to those of the ether-drift scientists, who postulated a material entrained ether.&nbsp; Direct evidence for the cosmic ether and ether-wind, by other names, are shown to have cosmic motions nearly identical to the older ether-drift findings: the interstellar wind, dark matter wind, cosmic ray wind, neutrino wind, and so forth.&nbsp; The implications for astrophysical theory are then discussed, even while empirical astronomy and space science engineering remains unchallenged. All the post-ether astrophysical <em>theories</em> are shown to be mired in mysticism and unproven assumptions.</p><p><strong><em>The Dynamic Ether of Cosmic Space</em></strong> provides over 100 photos and graphical illustrations, with a full published reference and web-reference section, an index, glossary and two Appendices. It is developed for the educated layperson and student, but most scientific professionals will find it eye-opening and refreshing.</p><p><em>A dynamic cosmic energy in space changes everything, indeed!</em></p></p><p>James DeMeo, PhD, formally studied the Earth, Atmospheric, and Environmental Sciences at Florida International University and later at the University of Kansas, where he earned his PhD in 1986.

In a time when the Church focused on external works, Madame Guyon looked to the heart of the matter and found that it is the prayers of the soul that God desires. This principle revolutionized her life, bringing her a new joy that she shared with all who would listen. As her following grew, so did her critics&#x2014;but they learned that true love can't be silenced. Three hundred years have passed since Madame Guyon's books were printed, and her words have remained as influential as when they were first written. Spiritual giants such as John Wesley, Watchman Nee, and Hudson Taylor testified to her work, but who can count the hundreds of thousands of souls touched by the life-changing nature of her insights? Experience the passion that Madame Guyon had for the Creator.Jeanne Guyon (1648 1717) wrote from the depth of her own spiritual experiences. Growing up in France during the decadent times of Louis XIV, she was devout at an early age, but was then caught up in the worldliness around her. After an arranged marriage at age fifteen, she became increasingly interested in spiritual things; and, for the rest of her life, she continued to seek God diligently, teach others, and write books on Christian devotion. These books have become Christian classics. Guyon paid a heavy price for her views and her writings. Throughout her life, she underwent various trials, including persecution and imprisonment for her beliefs. Her commentary on Song of Songs was used against her and led to her imprisonment.</p><h2>Perfect Imperfect: The Beauty Of Accident Age And Patina</h2><p><p>Perfect Imperfect takes as its founding principle the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi, advocating the beauty to be found in imperfection, impermanence and the authentic.

Over the next two decades, he returned to these characters again and again, tracing their years together raising children, finding moments of intermittent happiness, and facing the heartbreak of infidelity and estrangement. Seventeen Maples stories were collected in 1979 in a paperback edition titled <i>Too Far to Go, </i>prompted by a television adaptation. Now those stories appear in hardcover for the first time, with the addition of a later story, &#x201c;Grandparenting,&#x201d; which returns us to the Maples&#x2019;s lives long after their wrenching divorce.</p></p><p>John Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954, and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i>. He was the author of more than fifty books, including collections of short stories, poems, essays, and criticism. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize (twice), the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal. He died in 2009.<p>FOREWORD</p><p>THE MAPLES PRESENTED themselves to the writer in New York City in 1956, dropped from his sight for seven years, and reappeared in the suburbs of Boston in 1963, giving blood. They figured in a dozen stories since, until the couple&#x2019;s divorce in 1976. Their name, bestowed by a young man who had grown up in a small town shaded by Norway maples, and who then moved to the New England of sugar maples and flame-bright swamp maples, retained for him an arboreal innocence, a straightforward and cooling leafiness. Though the Maples stories trace the decline and fall of a marriage, they also illumine a history in many ways happy, of growing children and a million mundane moments shared. That a marriage ends is less than ideal; but all things end under heaven, and if temporality is held to be invalidating, then nothing real succeeds. The moral of these stories is that all blessings are mixed. Also, that people are incorrigibly themselves. The musical pattern, the advance and retreat, of the Maples&#x2019; duet is repeated over and over, ever more harshly transposed. They are shy, cheerful, and dissatisfied. They like one another, and aremysteries to one another. One of them is usually feeling slightly unwell, and the seesaw of their erotic interest rarely balances. Yet they talk, more easily than any other characters the author has acted as agent for. A tribe segregated in a valley develops an accent, then a dialect, and then a language all its own; so does a couple. Let this collection preserve one particular dead tongue, no easier to parse than Latin. To the fourteen Maples stories I have added two that from the internal evidence appear to take place in Richard Maple&#x2019;s mind, and a fragment that cried off completion.</p><p>In the thirty years since the above preface was written, this collection of linked stories, quickly assembled to coincide with a made-for-television movie called <i>Too Far to Go</i>, has had a gratifying career in paperback: in England as a Penguin book titled <i>Your Lover Just Called</i>, and in translations into, by my reckoning, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Serbian, Japanese, and Hebrew. Some of the German editions of <i>Der weite Weg zu zweit </i> were in hardcover, but this is the first hardbound edition in English. I was delighted to be told of it, and have availed myself of the opportunity to revise a few words and phrases, and to include one more Maples story, &#x2018;Grandparenting.&#x2019; The couple surprised me, in the mid-Eighties, by reappearing in a wintry Hartford, married to others but brought together by the birth of their first grandchild. I have not encountered them since, though mutual friends assure me that they are both still alive and look well, considering.</p><p>John Updike</p></p><h2>Rutland Place: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel</h2><p>London&#x2019;s most unusual sleuthing team, Inspector Thomas Pitt and his wife, Charlotte, just cannot seem to stay away from trouble.

He smiled sourly.<br><br>"Just imagine," he said. "Imagine what this feels like going through your head."<br><br>Grayther Crake didn't want to imagine anything of the sort. He was trying not to throw up, having already disgraced himself once that morning. He glanced at the man next to him, hoping for some sign that he had a plan, some way to get them out of this. But Darian Frey's face was hard and showed nothing.<br><br>Both of them had their wrists tied together, backs against the damp and peeling wall. Three armed thugs ensured they stayed there.<br><br>The smuggler's name was Lawsen Macarde. He was squat and grizzled, hair and skin greasy with a sheen of sweat and grime, features squashed across a face that was broad and deeply lined. Crake watched him slide the bullet into the empty drum of his revolver. He snapped it shut, spun it, then turned toward his audience.<br><br>"Do you think it hurts?" he mused. "Even for a moment? Or is it all over-bang!-in a flash?"<br><br>"If you're that curious, try it out on yourself," Frey suggested.<br><br>Macarde hit him in the gut, putting all of his considerable weight behind the punch. Frey doubled over with a grunt and almost went to his knees. He straightened with some effort until he was standing again.<br><br>"Good point," he wheezed. "Well made."<br><br>Macarde pressed the muzzle of the revolver against Crake's forehead and stared at Frey.<br><br>"Count of three. You want to see your man's brains all over the wall?"<br><br>Frey didn't reply. Crake's face was gray beneath his close-cropped blond beard. He stank of alcohol and sweat. His eyes flicked to the captain nervously.<br><br>"One."<br><br>Frey showed no signs of reacting.<br><br>"I'm just a passenger!" Crake said. "I'm not even part of his crew!" His accent betrayed an aristocratic upbringing that wasn't evident from his appearance. His hair was scruffy, his boots vomit-spattered, his greatcoat half unbuttoned and hanging open. He was near soiling himself with fear.<br><br>"You have the ignition code for the Ketty Jay?" Macarde asked him. "You know how to fire her up and get her flying?"<br><br>Crake swallowed and shook his head.<br><br>"Then shut up. Two."<br><br>"Nobody flies the Ketty Jay but me, Macarde. I told you that," Frey said. His eyes flickered restlessly around the storeroom. Cloud- muffled sunlight drifted in through horizontal slits high up on one stone wall, illuminating rough-hewn hemp sacks, coils of rope, wicked- looking hooks that hung on chains from the ceiling. Chill shadows cut deep into the seamed faces of Macarde and his men, and the air smelled of damp and decay.<br><br>"Three," said Macarde, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Crake flinched and whimpered as the hammer fell on an empty chamber. After a moment, it sank in: he was still alive. He let out a shuddering breath as Macarde took the gun away, then cast a hateful glare at Frey.<br><br>Frey's expression was blank. He was a different person from the man Crake had known the night before. That man had laughed as loud as Malvery and made fun of Pinn with the rest of them. He told stories that had them in stitches and drank until he passed out. That man, Crake had known for almost three months. That man, Crake might have called a friend.<br><br>Macarde studied the pistol theatrically. "Five chambers. One down. Think you'll be lucky again?" He put the muzzle back to Crake's forehead.<br><br>"Oh, please, no," Crake begged. "Please, please, no. Frey, tell him. Stop playing around and just tell him."<br><br>"One," said Macarde.<br><br>Crake stared at the now-stranger to his right, his eyes pleading. No doubt about it, it was the same man. There were the same wolfishly handsome features, the same unkempt black hair, the same lean frame beneath his long coat. But the spark in his eyes had gone. There was no sign of the ready, wicked smile that usually lurked at the corner of his mouth.<br><br>He wasn't going to give in.<br><br>"Two."<br><br>"Please," he whispered. But Frey just looked away.<br><br>"Three."<br><br>Macarde paused on the trigger, waiting for a last-moment intervention. It didn't come.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Crake's heart leaped hard enough to hurt. He let out a gasp. His mouth was sticky, his whole body was trembling, and he desperately wanted to be sick again.<br><br>You bastard, he thought. You rot-hearted bastard.<br><br>"Didn't think you had it in you, Frey," Macarde said, with a hint of admiration in his voice. He thrust the revolver back into a holster somewhere amid the motley of battered jackets that he wore. "You'd let him die rather than give up the Ketty Jay? That's cold."<br><br>Frey shrugged. "He's just a passenger." Crake swore at him under his breath.<br><br>Macarde paced around the storeroom while a rat-faced thug covered the prisoners with the point of a cutlass. The other two thugs stood in the shadows: an enormous shaven-headed bruiser and a droop-eyed man wearing a tatty knitted cap. One guarded the only exit, the other lounged against a barrel, idly examining a lever-action shotgun. There were a dozen more like them downstairs.<br><br>Crake clawed at his mind for some way to escape. In spite of the shock and the pounding in his head, he forced himself to be rational. He'd always prided himself on his discipline and self-control, which only made the humiliation of the last few moments harder to bear. He'd pictured himself displaying a little more dignity in the face of his own extinction.<br><br>Their pistols had been taken after they were found at the inn, snoring drunk at the table. Macarde had taken Frey's beautiful cutlass-my cutlass, Crake thought bitterly-for his own. Now it hung tantalizingly from his belt. Crake noticed Frey watching it closely.<br><br>What of Malvery and Pinn? They'd evidently wandered off elsewhere in the night to continue their carousing, leaving their companions to sleep. It was simply bad luck that Macarde had found him and Frey, tonight of all nights. A few more hours and they'd have been out of port and away. Instead, they'd been dragged upstairs-pausing only for Crake to be sick on his own feet-and bundled into this dank storeroom, where an anonymous and squalid death awaited them if Frey didn't give up the ignition codes for his aircraft.<br><br>I could be dead, Crake thought. That son of a bitch didn't do a thing to stop it.<br><br>"Listen," said Macarde to Frey. "Let's be businessmen about this. We go back, you and I. Worked together several times, haven't we? And even though I came to expect a certain sloppiness from you over the years-late delivery, cargo that wasn't quite what you promised, that sort of thing-you never flat-out screwed me. Not 'til now."<br><br>"What do you want me to say, Macarde? It wasn't meant to end up this way."<br><br>"I don't want to kill you, Frey," said Macarde in a tone that suggested the opposite. "I don't even want to kill that milksop little pansy over there. I just want what's mine. You owe me an aircraft. I'll take the Ketty Jay."<br><br>"The Ketty Jay's worth five of yours."<br><br>"Well, consider the difference as the price of me not cutting off your balls and stuffing them in your ears."<br><br>"That's fair," conceded Frey.<br><br>"That aerium you sold me was bad stuff. Admit it."<br><br>"What did you expect for that price?"<br><br>"You told me it came straight from the refinery. What you sold me was so degraded it wouldn't have lifted a biscuit, let alone twenty tons of aircraft."<br><br>"Sales patter. You know how it is."<br><br>"It must have been through the engines of every freebooter from here to the coast!" Macarde growled. "I'd have got better quality stuff siphoning it off the wrecks in a junkyard!"<br><br>Crake gave Frey a fleeting look of guilt. "Actually," grinned Frey, "it'd have been about the same."<br><br>Macarde's punch came blindingly fast, snapping Frey's head back so it cracked against the wall. Frey groaned and put his hands to his face. His fingertips came away bloody from a split lip.<br><br>"Little less attitude will make this all go a lot smoother," Macarde advised.<br><br>"Right," said Frey. "Now you listen. If there's some way I can make this up to you, some job I can do, something I can steal, whatever you want . . . well, that's one thing. But you will never get my craft, you hear? You can stuff whatever you like in my ears. The Ketty Jay is mine."<br><br>"I don't think you're in much of a position to negotiate," Macarde said.<br><br>"Really? 'Cause the way I see it, the Ketty Jay is useless without the ignition code, and the only one who knows it is me. That puts me in a pretty strong position as long as I don't tell you."<br><br>Macarde made a terse gesture toward Droop-Eye. "Cut off his thumbs."<br><br>Droop-Eye left his shotgun atop the barrel he'd been leaning on and drew a dagger.<br><br>"Whoa, wait!" said Frey quickly. "I'm talking compensation. I'm talking giving you more than the value of your craft. You cut off my thumbs and I can't fly. Believe me, you do that and I take the code to my grave."<br><br>"I had five men on that craft," said Macarde, as Droop-Eye came over. "They were pulling up out of a canyon. I saw it. The pilot tried to get the lift and suddenly it just wasn't there. Bad aerium, see? Couldn't clear the lip of the canyon. Tore the belly off, and the rest of it went up in flames. Five men dead. You going to compensate me for them too?"<br><br>"Listen, there's got to be something you want." He motioned suddenly at Crake. "Here, I know! He's got a gold tooth. Solid gold. Show them, Crake."<br><br>Crake stared at the captain in disbelief.<br><br>"I don't want a gold tooth, Frey," said Macarde patiently. "Give me your thumbs."<br><br>"It's a start!" Frey cried. He glared hard and meaningfully at Crake. "Crake, why don't you show them your gold tooth?"<br><br>"Here, let us have a look," Rat said, leaning closer to Crake. "Show us a smile, you little nancy."<br><br>Crake took a deep, steadying breath and gave Rat his most dazzling grin. It was a picture pose he'd perfected in response to a mortifying ferrotype taken by the family photographer. After that, he vowed he'd never be embarrassed by a picture again.<br><br>"Hey! That's not half bad," Rat commented, peering at his reflection in the shiny tooth. And Crake grinned, harder than he'd ever grinned in his life.<br><br>Droop-Eye pulled Frey away from the wall, over to a set of cobwebbed shelves. He swept away a few empty jars with his arm and then forced Frey's bound hands down onto the shelf. Frey had balled his fists and was refusing to extend his thumbs. Droop-Eye hammered him in the kidney, but he still held fast.<br><br>"What I'm saying, Macarde, is that we can both come out ahead," Frey argued through gritted teeth. "We'll work off the debt, me and my crew."<br><br>"You'll be halfway to New Vardia the second I take my eyes off you," Macarde replied.<br><br>"What about collateral? What if I leave you one of the fighters? Pinn has a Skylance; that thing's faster than greased owl shit. You ought to see it go!"<br><br>Droop-Eye drove a knee into his thigh, making him grunt, but Frey still wouldn't extend his thumbs. The thug by the door smirked at his companion's attempts to make Frey cooperate.<br><br>"Here, listen!" Rat shouted. Everyone stopped and turned to look at him, surprised by the volume of his voice. A strange expression crossed his face, as if he was puzzled to find himself the center of attention. Then it disappeared beneath a dawning revelation.<br><br>"Why don't we let them go?" he suggested.<br><br>Macarde gave him a reptilian glare. "What?" he said slowly.<br><br>"No, wait, hear me out," said Rat, with the attitude of one caught up in an idea so brilliant that it would require careful explanation to his benighted audience. "I mean, killing 'em won't do no good to us. They don't look like they've got a shillie to their name anyways. If we let 'em go, they could, you know, spread the good word and stuff: 'That Lawsen Macarde is a reasonable man. The kind of man you can do business with.' "<br><br>Macarde had been steadily reddening as Rat's speech went on, and now his unshaven jowls were trembling with fury. Droop-Eye and Bruiser exchanged wary glances. Neither of them knew what had possessed their companion to pipe up with his opinion, but they both knew the inevitable outcome. Macarde's hand twitched toward the hilt of Frey's cutlass.<br><br>"You should listen to the man," said Crake. "He talks a lot of sense."<br><br>Macarde's murderous gaze switched to Crake. Absurdly, Crake was still smiling. He flashed his toothy grin at Macarde now, looking for all the world like some oily salesman instead of a man facing his imminent demise.<br><br>But then Macarde noticed something. The anger drained from his face and he craned in to look a little closer.<br><br>"That's a nice tooth," he murmured.<br><br>Yes, keep looking, you ugly bag of piss, Crake thought to himself. You just keep looking.<br><br>Macarde's eyes glazed over, mesmerized. Crake directed every ounce of his willpower at the smuggler. Your man's idea isn't so bad, when you think about it. A show of generosity now will only increase your standing in the eyes of your customers. They'll come flocking with their deals, offering the best cuts for the privilege of working with you. You'll own this town!<br><br>But Macarde was smarter than Rat. The tooth worked only on the weak- minded. He was resisting; Crake could see it on his face. Even bewitched as he was by the tooth, Macarde sensed that something was amiss.<br><br>A chill spread through Crake's body, something icier and more insidious than simple fear. The tooth was draining him. Hungover and weak as he was, he couldn't keep up the fight for long, and he'd already used his best efforts on Rat.<br><br>Give it up, he silently begged Macarde. Just give it up.<br><br>Then the smuggler blinked, and his gaze cleared. He stared at Crake, shocked. Crake's grin faded slowly.<br><br>"He's a daemonist!" Macarde cried, then pulled the pistol from his holster, put it to Crake's head, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Macarde was as surprised as Crake was. He'd forgotten that he'd loaded his pistol with only a single bullet. There was an instant's pause, then everything happened at once.<br><br>Frey's cutlass flew out of Macarde's belt, leaping ten feet across the room, past Droop-Eye and into the captain's waiting hands. Droop- Eye's final moments were spent staring in incomprehension as Frey drove the cutlass double-handed into his belly.<br><br>Macarde's bewilderment at having his cutlass stolen by invisible hands gave Crake the time he needed to gather himself. He drove a knee hard into the fat man's groin. Macarde's eyes bulged and he staggered back a step, making a faint squealing noise like a distressed piglet.<br><br>His hands still bound, Crake wrestled the revolver from Macarde's beefy fingers just as Rat shook off the effects of the tooth and drew his own cutlass back for a thrust. Crake swung the gun about and squeezed the trigger. This time, the hammer found the bullet. It discharged point-blank in Rat's face, blowing a geyser of red mist from the back of his skull with a deafening bang. He tottered a few steps on his heels and collapsed onto a heap of rope.<br><br>Macarde was stumbling toward the door, unwittingly blocking Bruiser's line of fire. As the last thug fought to get an angle, Frey dropped his cutlass, darted across the room, and scooped up the lever-action shotgun that Droop-Eye had left on the barrel. Bruiser shoved his boss behind him to get a clear shot at Crake and succeeded only in providing one for Frey, who unloaded the shotgun into his chest wi...</p><h2>Eternity Invading Time</h2><p><p>In the Old Testament, God's people saw Him in a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. &#34;The Civil War in France&#34; was a pamphlet written by Karl Marx as an official statement of the General Council of the International on the character and significance of the struggle of the Parisian Communards in the French Civil War of 1871. In 1891, on the 20th anniversary of the Paris Commune, Engels put together a new edition of the work. He wrote an introduction to this edition, emphasizing the historical significance of the experience of the Paris Commune, and its theoretical generalization by Marx in &#34;The Civil War in France,&#34; and also providing additional information on the activities of the Communards from among the Blanquists and Proudhonists. Engels also decided to include earlier material by Marx made for the International - in this way providing additional historical background to the Commune from Marx&#39;s account of the Franco-Prussian War. For Marx, the history of the Paris Commune caused him to reassess the significance of some of his own earlier writings.</p><p></p><h2>On the Course with...Tiger Woods (Matt Christopher Sports Bio Bookshelf)</h2><p>Even before Tiger Woods stunned the world with his amazing victory at Augusta, he was impressing the golfing community with his perfect swing and pleasing crowds with his mile-wide smile and enthusiasm for the game. In this book, readers learn the details of Tiger&#39;s life and career. Photos.</p><p>Matt Christopher is the best selling name behind more than 100 sports-themed books for young readers.Grade 5-7-Narrator JD Jackson hits a hole in one while telling the triumphant story of golfer Tiger Woods, but the book by Matt Christopher (Little, 2002), while entertaining throughout, has trouble finishing under par. The first half of provides an absorbing, informative look at Woods and his parents. Tiger's African-American, part-Cherokee father met his half-Thai, half-Chinese mother in Thailand. They noticed early on that Tiger, when it came to golf, was a child prodigy. Woods' story is like a tall tale: at nine months he hit his first golf ball, and by two he was already demonstrating an ability to play the game. The early chapters are easily the best as Tiger wows the masses as a child appearing on television shows such as That's Incredible and The Mike Douglas Show. His dad, a former Green Beret, and mom, a Buddhist, taught Tiger how to concentrate and remain focused on his game. Jackson brings an energy and life to these sections, sounding impressed with Tiger's blossoming greatness. The second half of the book becomes less of a biography and more of a play-by-play rundown of Woods' triumphs and struggles in amateur and then professional competitions. Jackson makes every game sound exciting. We learn some superficial things about Tiger's life (he likes video games, he is friends with Michael Jordan), but very little about Woods the man. While Christopher does bring up controversies about Woods (the multimillion dollar product endorsements, Wood' rowdy fans shaking up what was once a quiet, reserved sport), the book is an exuberant ode to Tiger Woods and the ways in which he transformed golf into something new and exciting. Thanks to Jackson's narration, young fans will be cheering Woods all the way.<br><i>Brian E.

He is often messy and in-your-face in a way that can make you laugh (or shudder) when you least expect to. . . . <i>War Dances</i> is Alexie&#x2019;s fiercely freewheeling collection of stories and poems about the tragicomedies of ordinary lives.&#x201d; <i>O, the Oprah Magazine</i><br><br> Alexie has a wry, subversive sensibility. . . . The structure [in <i>War Dances</i>] is sophisticated yet playful, a subtle way to bring lightness to heavy topics such as senility, bigotry, cancer, and loneliness. . . .

He&#x2019;s unique, and his new book, <i>War Dances</i>, is another case in point.&#x201d; <i>Seattle Times</i><br><br> Alexie&#x2019;s works are piercing yet rueful. He writes odes to anguished pay-phone calls, to boys who would drive through blizzards to see a girl, to couples who need to sit together on airplane flights even though the computer thinks otherwise. . . . [A] marvelous collection.&#x201d;<i>Miami Herald</i><br><br> <i>War Dances</i> taps every vein and nerve, every tissue, every issue that quickens the current blood-pulse: parenthood, divorce, broken links, sex, gender and racial conflict, substance abuse, medical neglect, 9/11, Official Narrative vs. What Really Happened, settler religion vs. native spirituality, marketing, shopping, and war, war, war. All the heartbreaking ways we don&#x2019;t live now this is the caring, eye-opening beauty of this rollicking, bittersweet gem of a book.&#x201d; PEN/Faulkner judge Al Young<br><br> Few other contemporary writers seem willing to deal with issues of race, class, and sexuality as explicitly as Alexie . . . [ War Dances&#x201d; is] a virtuoso performance of wit and pathos, a cultural and familial critique and a son&#x2019;s quiet, worthless scream against the night as his father expires . . .

Fans will not be disappointed.&#x201d; <i>The Grand Rapids Press</i><br>From National Book Award&#x2013;winner Alexie comes a new collection of stories, poems, question and answer sequences, and hybrids of all three and beyond. In a penetrating voice that mixes humor with anger, Alexie pointedly asks, If it is true that children pay for the sins of their fathers, then is it also true that fathers pay for the sins of their children? Many of the stories revolve around the complexities of fatherhood; in the title story, the Native American narrator recalls his alcoholic father's death as he confronts his own mortality, and The Ballad of Paul Nonetheless is the tale of an eccentric vintage clothing salesman whose sexual attraction to his wife fades following the birth of their children. The collection also contains stirring defenses of artistic integrity; Fearful Symmetry is an incisive account of working as a young screenwriter for a Hollywood studio, and the poem Ode to Mix Tapes endorses hard work as the key ingredient behind any creation. Alexie unfurls highly expressive language, and while at times his jokes bomb and the characters' anger can feel forced, overall this is a spiritedly provocative array of tragic comedies. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One of His Majesty's highest physicians is dispatched from Spain to bring the latest advances in medical science to the backward peoples of the New World capital. Here begins the cyclical tale of man battling the unknown, of science confronting the eternally indifferent forces of nature. <br><br>Morales takes us on a trip through ancient and future civilizations, through exotic but all-too-familiar cultures, to a final confrontation with our own ethics and world views. In later chapters, the colonial physician finds his successors as they once again engage in life or death struggles, attempting to balance their own hopes, desires and loves with the good society and the state. Book II of the novel takes place in modern-day southern California, and Book III in a futuristic technocratic confederation known as Lamex. <br><br>In the tradition of Latin American born novelist, Alejandro Morales is one of the finest representatives of magic realism in the English language. In <i>The Rag Doll Plague</i>, Morales creates a many layered fictional world, taking us on an entertaining and thought-provoking safari thorough lands, times, peoples and ideas never before encountered or presented in this manner. But ultimately, this valuable trip leads to a reacquaintance with our own society and its moral vision.</p><p>Swarms of butterflies and hummingbirds, a jaguar on a leash, a hero who's writing himself into existence, beneficent ghosts of ancestors--all the trappings of post-Borges magic realism are gathered in this undeniably derivative and yet often quite funny, quirky meditation on Mexican-American relations, the politics of epidemics and the uses of history. To pack all that into a mere 200 pages, Morales foreshortens, stylizes, and truncates plots and characters, creating a series of rigid allegorical tableaux with the static vitality and crudeness of a barrio mural. In Book One, Dr. Gregorio Revueltas, a physician sent from Spain to Mexico in 1788 (significant date), seeks a cure for a plague ravaging the colony. Spanish oppression of the natives, the Inquisition's persecution of indigenous curanderos, exacerbate the suffering. Only after the outbreak of the French Revolution does the plague, wrought by microbes and compounded by human stupidity, subside. In Book Two, Chicano doctor Revueltas (ca. 1950-85) works in a southern California barrio clinic where violence, drugs, and AIDS are the names of the plague, again both viral and social in its origins. This chapter is the least satisfactory. AIDS is too close and too complex and Morales hasn't thought about it enough. His lack of grounding even in the medical facts undermines his fantasy. Book Three is set in the late 21st- century world of LAMEX, a rigidly stratified hi-tech society that includes both L.A. and Mexico City. The sci-fi social satire is full of vivid scenes and liberating inventions--every pharmacy, for instance, carries the cures for AIDS and cancer. The plague now is environmental. It comes from the sea, and when it strikes, whole cities perish overnight. Another Dr. Revueltas reads his ancestors' plague-year diaries and, fortified by his sense of the past, discovers not only a cure for this plague but a way to turn the social order upside down, putting the poorest Mexicans on top for a while. Morales (The Brick People, Death of an Anglo--both 1988) offers a novel that exhibits the very qualities it celebrates: energy, hopefulness, a reverence for roots. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Mexican fiction writer Morales ( Brick People ) exhibits his range in a novel showing Hispanic doctors battling deadly infectious diseases over three centuries. The first section, a rather formal historical account, tells of an 18th-century Spanish physician sent to Mexico to diagnose and cure a plague, LaMona. The epidemic eventually subsides by itself, but the physician has fallen in love with New Spain and decided to make it his home. A contemporary Hispanic doctor living in Los Angeles affectingly narrates the book's second portion. When his wife, a hemophiliac, contracts AIDS through a contaminated blood transfusion, he takes her to Mexico to participate in an Indian healing ritual; although spiritually uplifting, the ceremony cannot halt the disease's ravages. The second doctor's grandson, also a physician, relates the final story, set in the future. A plague eerily similar to LaMona sweeps the population of Lamex, a U.S./Mexican technocratic confederation. The medical establishment is helpless until the narrator discovers that transfusions from pure-blooded Mexico City residents will cure the disease--the metropolis is so hideously polluted that its inhabitants' blood has genetically mutated, developing an antibody to the plague. Morales's unabashed ethnic chauvinism becomes hard to take: AIDS, it appears, was invented in a U.S. laboratory and exported to Africa; the Anglo-European presence that has oppressed Mexicans for centuries finally gets its just deserts in the SF finale. However, inventive writing and interesting premises spark the work. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Secret of the Veda, New U.S. Edition</h2><p>Sri Aurobindo breaks new ground in interpreting the ancient Vedas.

In understated, crystalline prose, Lax details her experiences with arranged marriage, fundamentalist faith, and motherhood during her years with the Hasidim, and explores how her creative, sexual, and spiritual longings simmer beneath the surface throughout her time there. The first memoir to tell of a gay woman who spent years in the Hasidic fold, <i>Uncovered</i> is the moving story of Lax's journey toward finding a home where she truly belongs.</p><p>Leah Lax has won awards in both fiction and nonfiction and her work has been included in numerous anthologies and publications, print and online--including <i>Dame</i>, <i>Lilith</i>, and <i>Salon</i>. Her work for stage has been reviewed in <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine, and has been broadcast on NPR.

All over the world are women whose bodies are covered, not by their own decision, but by one of the many patriarchal religions that by definition rule their wombs. Leah Lax lived that life, yet has the spirit, courage and honesty to tell her story. It's been said that, if one woman told the truth, the world would split open. If others follow her, it just might.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Gloria Steinem<br>&#x201c;Aching, absorbingly told, and with genuine tenderness toward the damaged, struggling, and sometimes helpful souls who populate a life, <i>Uncovered</i> is a marvelous memoir, one in which any reader will find echoes of our own quests for an authentic life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mark Doty, National Book Award author of <i>Fire to Fire</i>, <i>Firebird</i>, and <i>Deep Lane</i><br>&#x201c;Absolutely stunning! With memorable, passionate detail, Leah Lax recounts a unique search for wholeness and healing that paradoxically plunged her into the quicksand of shame. Written in poetic prose whose color and savor will linger long after you finish the book, this memoir makes the flickering appeal of a life of inflexible rules as seductively clear as it is claustrophobic&#x2015;a remarkable achievement. Dramatic, revelatory, deeply moving, and ultimately inspiring, this is a truly one-of-a kind memoir about the universal longing to discover, nurture, and celebrate one&#x2019;s authentic self.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Lev Raphael, author of <i>My Germany: A Jewish Author Returns to the World His Parents Escaped</i><br>&#x201c;In this courageous, important book, Leah Lax reveals a voice once doubly silenced by orthodox religion&#x2015;as a woman and a lesbian&#x2015;on a deeply moving journey to selfhood.

Her book is a profound and poignant story of innocence and experience, those ancient universals, and transforming joy at the end.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rosellen Brown, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Before and After</i><br>&#x201c;<i>Uncovered</i> is masterful&#x2015;searingly honest and lyrically rendered.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;American Library Association, GLBT Reviews<br>&#x201c;Dealing with abortion, LGBT identity, and Hasidic life, this story is too complex to fit neatly into the &#x2018;ex-Hasidic memoir craze&#x2019;&#x2014;but that makes it all the richer.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Flavorwire</i><br>&#x201c;The defining magic of this memoir is in every immediate detail . . .

Having long had a fascination with prehistoric rock art, I picked up this book on a visit to Victoria, B.C. It is a concise and clearly written treatise on the topic. It explains the relationship between religion and art, cosmology and self-expression. Beth Hill's descriptions of rock carvings written in the context of their possible shamanistic meanings bring each engraved scene she describes to life. So much so in fact that the book inspired me to write a short story called "Petroglyphs" which was published by Fictionwise.com. For such a small book, it is one of the most complete treatments I have read. The black and white pictures are great, and she gives you the story behind each example.

Beginning with the rather bold and decidedly controversial assertion that the current political system in place in the United States at the dawn of the twenty-first century is fascism, the first part of this book attempts to justify that claim by first defining exactly what fascism iscorrecting various widely-held misconceptionsand then analyzing how closely we as a nation conform to that definition. Also included is a review of some of the hidden history and key events of World War II. Part II offers a retrospective of the twentieth century American presidential administrations, to demonstrate that the steady and inexorable march towards overt fascism was a defining characteristic that remained unchanged. The final section looks at the still very much alive eugenics movement, and analyzes the role played by the psychiatric establishment in validating the fascist state. This book will surely find no shortage of detractors, but if read with an open mind, it just may change the way you view the world.</p><p>David McGowan is a freelance writer/researcher living in the Los Angeles area and the author of Derailing Democracy (Common Courage Press, 2000).

While his mother Mimi struggled to understand and come to terms with the fact that her child may be transgender, she experienced a sense of d�j� vu&#x2014;the journey to uncover the source of her child&#x2019;s inner turmoil unearthed ghosts from Mimi&#x2019;s past and her own struggle to live an authentic life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mimi was raised in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family, every aspect of her life dictated by ancient rules and her role as a woman largely preordained from cradle to grave. As a young woman, Mimi wrestled with the demands of her faith and eventually made the painful decision to leave her religious community and the strict gender roles it upheld.<br> &nbsp;<br> Having risen from the ashes of her former life, Mimi was prepared to help her son forge a new one &#x2014; at a time when there was little consensus on how best to help young transgender children. Dual narratives of faith and motherhood weave together to form a heartfelt portrait of an unforgettable family.

A parable about compassion-and the absence of it-Dark Remedy is a gripping account of thalidomide&#39;s extraordinary impact on the lives of individuals and nations over half a century.</p><p>Twentieth-century science is too complex for any one reader's apprehension, so we look for stories that help us grasp its enormity. The jubilant discovery, demonization, and subsequent rehabilitation of thalidomide offers a wide-ranging outline of public attitudes toward science following World War&nbsp;II, and the authors of <i>Dark Remedy: The Impact of Thalidomide and Its Revival As a Vital Medicine</i> tell the story well. Historian Rock Brynner and embryologist Trent Stephens--who may have finally determined the drug's mechanism of action in 1998--treat us to both a devastating indictment of the under-regulated pharmaceutical industry of the 1950s and a penetrating study of thalidomide's reintroduction into mainstream medicine through the black market. The powerful anti-inflammatory properties of the drug make it a popular choice for treating arthritis, leprosy, some cancers, AIDS, MS, and many other debilitating illnesses, but it has only recently won grudging approval. Though the its tone can be acidic (in one instance referring to the "Utopian prosthetics custom-designed for the deformities caused by Utopian medicine"), the book is, for the most part, fair to the corporations that caused and then ignored the epidemic of birth defects, the victims who understandably tried to prevent the drug's revival, and the regulators who were too often bound by short-sighted legislation to do their jobs. The heroes and villains are larger than life, the stories and the science are equally compelling, and <i>Dark Remedy</i> ultimately combines the best elements of journalism and myth. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Rock Brynner</b>, historian and novelist, earned his M.A. in Philosophy from Trinity College, Dublin, and his Ph.D. in History from Columbia University.

Now Brooke has returned on business to discover that some things never change. Her spotted reputation remains. Tongues still wag. And that makes what should be her dream assignment tough.Brooke has been hired to design new stained glass windows at Hayden Bible Church. The job is a career windfall. But Nick Marcello is overseeing the project, and some in the church think Nick and Brooke&#x2019;s relationship is not entirely professional--and as before, there is no convincing those people otherwise. In the face of mounting rumors, the two set out to produce the masterpiece Nick has conceived: a brilliant set of windows displaying God&#x2019;s covenants in the Bible. For Brooke, it is more than a project--it is a journey toward faith. But opposition is heating up. A vicious battle of words and will is about to tax Brooke&#x2019;s commitment to the limit.

It surprised her that the congregation of Hayden Bible Church---usually much tighter with their purse strings than they were with their gossip---had decided to allocate funds to buy the building and renovate it. It surprised her even more that they had hired her to design the stained-glass windows that would replace the broken-out glass. There had been a time when the people of Hayden, Missouri, wouldn&#39;t have hired her to mop their floors. Apparently, things had changed. And it was about time. She left her car and walked around the building to the small employee parking lot in the rear, skirted by pine trees and one sprawling oak that shaded the pavement from the early spring sun. Only one car occupied a space there---a 1980 Buick with a rusty back fender and a dent in the driver&#39;s door. She stopped at the sight of it, and for a split second gave serious thought to running back to her own car and out of Hayden in the time it would take to say &#39;not again . . .&#39; Her hands began to tremble, and she dropped her portfolio to her side. Inhaling deeply, she let her troubled gaze drift to the church door. Anger swelled migraine---like in her temples. Had crucial details been left out of this job offer? A March breeze whispered through her hair, as if trying to calm her, and she paused at the door and told herself that it wasn&#39;t facing Nick Marcello now that bothered her so. It was that she hadn&#39;t faced him before. She had simply run away. But what else could she have done? With the town rejoicing over the juiciest piece of gossip they&#39;d ever scavenged, she had gotten out of town as fast as she could, hoping to spare her family any more shame. But this time, Brooke reminded herself with a grim lift of her chin, she had made a pact with herself. She had vowed that when she came back to take this job, she would face the town with dignity and integrity, and then, by creating a work of art that would send them all reeling, she would redeem herself. She had assumed that process would involve facing Nick Marcello again. She just hadn&#39;t expected to do it so soon. She opened the door and stepped into the musty old sanctuary. The door creaked behind her, then slammed with an echoing thud. She stood quietly for a moment, listening, looking. &#39;Deliveries go back here!&#39; That familiar voice came from just inside the darkened corridor at the back, and she forced herself to move. Stepping over a beam on the old wood floor and around a dusty pew lying on its back, she made her way to the only doorway with light. She saw him standing at a table, bent over a blueprint, studying it intently. He seemed younger than he had when she was in high school. But maybe it was just that she was older. She recalled the dress shirts and ties he&#39;d always worn, the freshly pressed trousers, the shiny loafers. Now he wore an old flannel shirt, paint-stained jeans, and tennis shoes. &#39;No delivery,&#39; she said. &#39;Just me.&#39; He looked up, then slowly straightened. &#39;Brooke.&#39; Brooke tried to smile, but the effort was too much for her. &#39;I ... I didn&#39;t know you would be here. Pastor Anderson said---&#39; &#39;If you&#39;d known, you wouldn&#39;t have come.&#39; He crossed the room, still keeping distance between them. &#39;That&#39;s why I asked him to call for me.&#39; &#39;He should have told me.&#39; He nodded, as if he&#39;d already given that a lot of thought. &#39;I&#39;m in charge of artistic development in the renovation,&#39; he said. &#39;But to be perfectly honest, that consists mainly of those windows. I&#39;m going to be helping you design them. The church is counting on them being a new point of interest in the sanctuary. I&#39;m counting on them being a masterpiece.&#39; Brooke set her jaw and walked to the table, processing the information that changed everything. &#39;I don&#39;t know, Mr. Marcello.&#39; &#39;Brooke, I haven&#39;t taught in seven years, and you&#39;re still calling me Mr. Marcello? It&#39;s Nick, okay? Say it. Nick.&#39; She looked down at her feet. &#39;Okay, I don&#39;t know, Nick.&#39; Nick stepped toward her, and reluctantly, she brought her eyes up to his. &#39;You don&#39;t know what, Brooke?&#39; he asked. &#39;If you can create a masterpiece, or if you can work with me?&#39; &#39;Both. It&#39;s nice seeing you. But I can&#39;t stay.&#39; She turned and walked back into the darkness of the corridor, down the hall, and back into the old sanctuary. Nick followed. &#39;Look, I didn&#39;t hire you for this job because of any of that mess. I hired you because you&#39;re talented.

It wasn&#39;t often that she was recognized as an artist. Most people viewed her as an interior decorator of sorts, someone who added life to dull rooms. &#39;I&#39;ve always wanted to work with you,&#39; Nick said quietly. &#39;Ever since you were in high school and I saw the talent you had. I know we could do something really amazing with these windows.&#39; &#39;This is the first time I&#39;ve been back to Hayden since---&#39; She glanced up at him, steadied her voice. &#39;Since I graduated.

They begin interacting with screens at around four months old. But is this good news or bad news? A wonderful opportunity to connect around the world? Or the first step in creating a generation of addled screen zombies?<br>Many have been quick to declare this the dawn of a neurological and emotional crisis, but solid science on the subject is surprisingly hard to come by. In <i>The Art of Screen Time</i>, Anya Kamenetz--an expert on education and technology, as well as a mother of two young children--takes a refreshingly practical look at the subject. Surveying hundreds of fellow parents on their practices and ideas, and cutting through a thicket of inconclusive studies and overblown claims, she hones a simple message, a riff on Michael Pollan's well-known "food rules": Enjoy Screens. Not too much. Mostly with others.<br>This brief but powerful dictum forms the backbone of a philosophy that will help parents moderate technology in their children's lives, curb their own anxiety, and create room for a happy, healthy family life with and without screens.</p><p><b>Anya Kamenetz</b> is the lead digital education correspondent for NPR. Previously she worked as a staff writer for <i>Fast Company</i> magazine.

Sometimes called "The Sleeping Prophet," he was prone to pick up taglines that reflected the sensationalistic side of his work rather than its real depth and meaning. The core of his life's work was actually being an intuitive healer and Christian mystic. <br><br> More than one hundred books have been written about his teachings and his life story. Yet no book has combined insightful commentary with lengthy, verbatim selections of the full range of his contribution to holistic healing, practical spirituality, and the psychology of the soul. <br><br> <i>The Essential Edgar Cayce</i> gives the reader an understanding of each major area in which Cayce helped pioneer the modern holistic living movement, as well as the contemporary popular approach to spirituality that weaves together the best of Eastern and Western religious traditions. The book's substantial introduction frames Cayce and his life's work, and is followed by eight topical sections in which commentaries by Mark Thurston guide the reader through some of the seer's most significant readings. <br><br> Here is a truly integral portrait of the life and work of one of the twentieth century's most fascinating spiritual figures.</p><p>Mark Thurston, Ph.D., is a psychologist, educator, and the author of seventeen books dealing with practical spirituality and soul growth.

In this book, he looks at walled gardens throughout England and Wales and explores their history, innovative design and cultural heritage.The walled garden was once an essential component of every country house, its shelter providing ideal conditions for growing food, flowers and medicine. This book from the National Trust looks at walled gardens throughout England and Wales and explores their history, innovative design and cultural heritage.Walled gardens are a feature of British gardening history. In the late 18th century, gardens became status symbols, with aristocrats vying to grow ever more exotic fruits &#x2013; ushering in innovations such as glasshouses and even heated walls. With the First and Second World Wars many of these gardens fell into disrepair, but renovated ones feature at many key National Trust properties and remain a source of pride and fascination today.</p><p><b>Jules Hudson</b> is an archeologist who hosts the BBC show <i>Escape to the Country</i>.Over the last decade, Jules has established himself as an engaging and versatile writer and broadcaster.

It's Fletcher-disoriented, beaten, and covered in blood.

Adam yelled over his shoulder.</p> <p>Fletcher could hear Adam's laughter echoing back at him as he pumped his legs, intent on keeping the deep green of Adam's jacket in sight as he dodged through the forest.</p> <p>There was no way Fletcher could catch Adam unless Adam stopped or dropped dead. Adam was the quarterback who brought Dan River Falls High School victory after victory, and Fletcher was the "weird kid" who sat at the back of the bleachers and drew in his notebook.</p> <p>"Come on!"</p> <p>A second wind broke through Fletcher's chest, and he felt the burn of adrenaline rush through his legs. He fisted his hands as the cool air dried the sweat on his forehead. A loopy smile cracked across his face. He could see Adam. He was gaining on him-not fast, but steadily. Adam was caught in the crosshairs of Fletcher's gaze.</p> <p>"Who you calling &#x2018;loser'?" Fletcher called, still grinning.</p> <p>Up ahead, Adam stopped, head bent, shoulders heaving as he struggled for breath. He was doubled over, staring at something on the ground. "My God, Fletch. Dude, you've got to see this."</p> <p> </p> <p>It was just after six o'clock as Avery watched pink bleed into the sunny blue sky, casting a haze of twilight over the parking lot at the Dan River Falls Police Station. The cup of coffee that sat in front of her-more vanilla creamer than coffee-had long since gone cold.</p> <p>A man strode into the room, his black uniform pressed so each crease was razor sharp. He was no-nonsense from head to toe: salt-and-pepper hair cut close to his skull, dark eyes focused, thin lips pressed together in a scowl. He walked past Avery and dropped a thick manila file folder on the giant desk.</p> <p>"Dad," Avery moaned, pulling out the word. "Can we go yet?"</p> <p>Chief Templeton looked at his daughter as if just noticing her-as if she hadn't been sitting there in that same spot for the last forty minutes.</p> <p>"The line is going to be out the door. I'm going to starve to death while we wait."</p> <p>"Not now, Avery."</p> <p>"Fine. Then we're hitting the drive-through with the lights and siren on. I'm pretty sure my stomach is eating itself."</p> <p>"Your stomach eating itself? Not happening, Avy."</p> <p>"It happens! We talked about it in biology." It was a lie. Avery had no idea whether or not the stomach could or would eat itself. But it felt like it. She was going to launch into some other wild story to make the stern police chief crack a smile and bring him back to acting like her dad. But when he turned, Avery could see that there was no playfulness in his eyes. His lips weren't going to quirk up into a smile no matter how hard she tried. She swallowed, fear inching up the back of her neck.</p> <p>"What's wrong, Dad?"</p> <p> </p> <p>He couldn't remember the first blow, though his teeth were still rattling in his head. Had he been punched, shot, hit? His vision was a blur, and everything around him, every tree, every rock, seemed to blend together in one united mass of gray. He wasn't sure if the sky was above or below him, if the trees were standing or if he was.</p> <p>Another blow.</p> <p>The pain was dense at first, then exploded into a blinding burn. He blinked, dumbfounded, and tried to face his attacker. But his body was leaden. It was as if his feet were rooted in the soft blanket of pine needles on the damp forest ground. He knew he should roll his fingers into a fist and take a swing, but while his brain worked, his body didn't. Thoughts of action tossed around in his skull-run, yell, fight, punch-but everything moved in sickly slow motion except for the terror that overwhelmed him.</p> <p>I'm going to die.</p> <p>The thought came to him with a sickening dread.</p> <p>I don't want to die.</p> <p>Then came a gruesome thud followed by a sharp crack. The sound filled his ears before he registered that it was his bones breaking. Snap, crack. He knew another blow was coming and he tried to brace himself, balling up, wondering if the next hit would be the one that killed him.</p></p><h2>The Calling: 3 Fundamental Shifts to Stay True, Get Paid, and Do Good</h2><p><p><b>Are you willing to believe in you?</b></p><p>Every single one of us has a calling.</p><p>For most it&#x2019;s the thing you have to force yourself not to do.</p><p>When you try to ignore it, you can&#x2019;t stop thinking about.

Described by author Peter FitzSimons as &#34;a true Adults Only version of Lord of the Flies, meeting Nightmare on Elm Street,&#34; the story is set in 1629, when the pride of the Dutch East India Company, the Batavia, is on its maiden voyage en route from Amsterdam to the Dutch East Indies, laden down with the greatest treasure to leave Holland. The magnificent ship is already boiling over with a mutinous plot that is just about to break into the open when, just off the coast of Western Australia, it strikes an unseen reef in the middle of the night. While Commandeur Francisco Pelsaert decides to take the long-boat across 2000 miles of open sea for help, his second-in-command Jeronimus Cornelisz takes over, quickly deciding that 250 people on a small island is unwieldy for the small number of supplies they have. Quietly, he puts forward a plan to 40 odd mutineers how they could save themselves, kill most of the rest and spare only a half-dozen or so women, including his personal fancy, Lucretia Jansz - one of the noted beauties of Holland - to service their sexual needs. A reign of terror begins, countered only by a previously anonymous soldier Wiebbe Hayes, who begins to gather to him those are prepared to do what it takes to survive . . . hoping against hope that the Commandeur will soon be coming back to them with the rescue yacht. It all happened, long ago, and it is for a very good reason that Peter FitzSimons has long maintained that this is &#34;far and away the greatest story in Australia&#39;s history, if not the world&#39;s.&#34; FitzSimons unique writing style has made him the country&#39;s best-selling non-fiction writer over the last ten years, and he is perfect man to make this bloody, chilling, stunning tale come alive.</p><p><b>Peter FitzSimons</b> is a journalist with the <i>Sun-Herald</i> and the&nbsp;<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, and the author of more than 20 books, including <i>How Hemlines Predict the Economy</i> and <i>Mawson</i>.</p><h2>Rosalind Franklin and DNA</h2><p><p><strong>Rosalind Franklin's research was central to the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA.

We get all four here, and they come at us under the doors, in through the windows. One morning you wake and need blankets; you take the fan out of the window to see clouds that mist out by midmorning, only to reveal a naked blue coolness like God yawning.</p> <p>September is perfect Oregon. The blocks line up like postcards and the rosebuds bloom into themselves like children at bedtime. And in Portland we are proud of our roses; year after year, we are proud of them. When they are done, we sit in the parks and read stories into the air, whispering the gardens to sleep.</p> <p>I come here, to Palio Coffee, for the big windows. If I sit outside, the sun gets on my computer screen, so I come inside, to this same table, and sit alongside the giant panes of glass. And it is like a movie out there, like a big screen of green, and today there is a man in shepherd's clothes, a hippie, all dirty, with a downed bike in the circle lawn across the street. He is eating bread from the bakery and drinking from a metal camp cup. He is tapping the cup against his leg, sitting like a monk, all striped in fabric. I wonder if he is happy, his blanket strapped to the rack on his bike, his no home, his no job. I wonder if he has left it all because he hated it or because it hated him. It is true some do not do well with conventional life. They think outside things and can't make sense of following a line. They see no walls, only doors from open space to open space, and from open space, supposedly, to the mind of God, or at least this is what we hope for them, and what they hope for themselves.</p> <p>I remember the sweet sensation of leaving, years ago, some ten now, leaving Texas for who knows where. I could not have known about this beautiful place, the Oregon I have come to love, this city of great people, this smell of coffee and these evergreens reaching up into a mist of sky, these sunsets spilling over the west hills to slide a red glow down the streets of my town.</p> <p>And I could not have known then that if I had been born here, I would have left here, gone someplace south to deal with horses, to get on some open land where you can see tomorrow's storm brewing over a high desert. I could not have known then that everybody, every person, has to leave, has to change like seasons; they have to or they die. The seasons remind me that I must keep changing, and I want to change because it is God's way. All my life I have been changing. I changed from a baby to a child, from soft toys to play daggers. I changed into a teenager to drive a car, into a worker to spend some money. I will change into a husband to love a woman, into a father to love a child, change houses so we are near water, and again so we are near mountains, and again so we are near friends, keep changing with my wife, getting our love so it dies and gets born again and again, like a garden, fed by four seasons, a cycle of change. Everybody has to change, or they expire. Everybody has to leave, everybody has to leave their home and come back so they can love it again for all new reasons.</p> <p>I want to keep my soul fertile for the changes, so things keep getting born in me, so things keep dying when it is time for things to die. I want to keep walking away from the person I was a moment ago, because a mind was made to figure things out, not to read the same page recurrently.</p> <p>Only the good stories have the characters different at the end than they were at the beginning. And the closest thing I can liken life to is a book, the way it stretches out on paper, page after page, as if to trick the mind into thinking it isn't all happening at once.</p> <p>Time has pressed you and me into a book, too, this tiny chapter we share together, this vapor of a scene, pulling our seconds into minutes and minutes into hours. Everything we were is no more, and what we will become, will become what was. This is from where story stems, the stuff of its construction lying at our feet like cut strips of philosophy. I sometimes look into the endless heavens, the cosmos of which we can't find the edge, and ask God what it means. Did You really do all of this to dazzle us? Do You really keep it shifting, rolling round the pinions to stave off boredom? God forbid Your glory would be our distraction. And God forbid we would ignore Your glory.</p> <p>HERE IS SOMETHING I FOUND TO BE TRUE: YOU DON'T start processing death until you turn thirty. I live in visions, for instance, and they are cast out some fifty years, and just now, just last year I realized my visions were cast too far, they were out beyond my life span. It frightened me to think of it, that I passed up an early marriage or children to write these silly books, that I bought the lie that the academic life had to be separate from relational experience, as though God only wanted us to learn cognitive ideas, as if the heart of a man were only created to resonate with movies. No, life cannot be understood flat on a page. It has to be lived; a person has to get out of his head, has to fall in love, has to memorize poems, has to jump off bridges into rivers, has to stand in an empty desert and whisper sonnets under his breath:</p> <p>I'll tell you how the sun rose <br> A ribbon at a time... </p> <p> It's a living book, this life; it folds out in a million settings, cast with a billion beautiful characters, and it is almost over for you. It doesn't matter how old you are; it is coming to a close quickly, and soon the credits will roll and all your friends will fold out of your funeral and drive back to their homes in cold and still and silence. And they will make a fire and pour some wine and think about how you once were . . . and feel a kind of sickness at the idea you never again will be.</p> <p>So soon you will be in that part of the book where you are holding the bulk of the pages in your left hand, and only a thin wisp of the story in your right. You will know by the page count, not by the narrative, that the Author is wrapping things up. You begin to mourn its ending, and want to pace yourself slowly toward its closure, knowing the last lines will speak of something beautiful, of the end of something long and earned, and you hope the thing closes out like last breaths, like whispers about how much and who the characters have come to love, and how authentic the sentiments feel when they have earned a hundred pages of qualification.</p> <p>And so my prayer is that your story will have involved some leaving and some coming home, some summer and some winter, some roses blooming out like children in a play. My hope is your story will be about changing, about getting something beautiful born inside of you, about learning to love a woman or a man, about learning to love a child, about moving yourself around water, around mountains, around friends, about learning to love others more than we love ourselves, about learning oneness as a way of understanding God. We get one story, you and I, and one story alone. God has established the elements, the setting and the climax and the resolution. It would be a crime not to venture out, wouldn't it?</p> <p>It might be time for you to go. It might be time to change, to shine out. </p> <p>I want to repeat one word for you: </p> <p>Leave.</p> <p>Roll the word around on your tongue for a bit. It is a beautiful word, isn't it? So strong and forceful, the way you have always wanted to be. And you will not be alone. You have never been alone. Don't worry. Everything will still be here when you get back. It is you who will have changed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Chapter One </b> <strong><br> Leaving</strong></p> <p>HOUSTON, TEXAS, AT NIGHT, AS SEEN FROM INTERSTATE 45, is something beautiful. The interstate approaches and collides with the city's center in a tight, second-level loop that hugs skyscrapers three-quarters around downtown before spinning off north toward Dallas and south toward the Gulf coast. It is, as you know, an enormous city, its skyline brilliant with architecture and light. A landlocked lighthouse on the flat surface of south Texas. </p> <p>Tonight she shines. The towers are lit and the road is ours alone. A bank sign marks the time at 2:30 a.m., alternately flashing the temperature at seventy-three degrees. Houston has an empty feel to it at such an hour. Her size demands traffic and noise. But this is a southern city and people sleep at proper hours, leaving the landscape to changing street signals with nobody to obey their commands. Night travel is best. Mild, thick air pours through the windows like river water, flowing in circles around our heads. Paul and I are quiet, our thoughts muffled by the tin-can rattle of his 1971 Volkswagen camping van. We are traveling north toward Oklahoma and then, perhaps, the Grand Canyon. After that, we have no plans except to arrive in Oregon before we run out of money. We share a sense of excitement and freedom. Not a rebel freedom, rather, a deadline-free sort of peace. There is nowhere we have to be tomorrow. There is no particular road we have committed to take, and I suppose, if one of us could talk the other out of it, the canyon itself could be bypassed for some other pointof interest. Tonight we are travelers in the truest sense of the word, a slim notion of a final destination and no schedule to speak of. We are simply moving for motion's sake. </p> <p>Our plans were shared with friends, but few understood. "Going off to find yourself" was the standard interpretation. I don't think that is really our point. We are shaped by our experiences. Our perception of joy, fear, pain, and beauty are sharpened or dulled by the way we rub against time.

The chronicle of Carrie Meeber's rise from obscurity to fame &#x2014; and the effects of her progress on the men who use her and are used in turn &#x2014; aroused a storm of controversy and debate upon its debut in 1900. The author's nonjudgmental portrait of a heroine who violates the contemporary moral code outraged some critics, including the book's publisher, Frank Doubleday, who tried to back out of his agreement his firm had made with Dreiser. But others were elated &#x2014; and Dreiser's compelling plot and realistic characters continue to fascinate readers.<br>"Sister Carrie stands outside the brief traffic of the customary stage. It leaves behind an inescapable impression of bigness, of epic sweep and dignity. It is not a mere story, not a novel in the customary American meaning of the word; it is at once a psalm of life and a criticism of life ... [Dreiser's] aim is not merely to tell a tale; his aim is to show the vast ebb and flow of forces which sway and condition human destiny. The thing he seeks to do is to stir, to awaken, to move. One does not arise from such a book as <i>Sister Carrie</i> with a smirk of satisfaction; one leaves it infinitely touched." &#x2014; H. L. Mencken</p><p></p></p><p><i>Sister Carrie</i>, Theodore Dreiser's revolutionary first novel, was published in 1900--sort of. The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><h2>The Cream of Tank Girl</h2><p>Spewing filth and fury since 1988, celebrate the 20th anniversary of Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett&#x2019;s foul-mouthed, anarchic creation with <i>The Cream of Tank Girl</i>! <br><br>Boasting tons of unseen artwork, rarely seen comic strips, every Jamie Hewlett <i>Tank Girl</i> cover ever, publicity posters, script samples and more besides, this is the ultimate guide to Tank Girl and her world! <br><br>Bask in the glory of exclusive new commentary from writer Alan Martin!

Over 2,500 monogrammatic and alphabetic designs are displayed in plates from "Dictionnaire du Chiffre-monogramme," etc., by Charles Demengeot (1881); "Monograms and Ciphers," by H. Renoir (1870&#x2013;74); "Knight's New Book of Seven Hundred &amp; Fifty Eight Plain, Ornamented &amp; Reversed Cyphers" (1830); and "Monograms in Three and Four Letters," by J. Gordon Smith (n.d.).<br>There are monograms in every two-letter combination and extensive selections of three and four letters; name devices ("Alice," "Theodore," etc.), crowns, crests, coats of arms and helmets. There are heavy, intricately entwined monograms that appear as though engraved on metal; lighter, thick-and-thin script styles; fanciful and formal designs; monograms in circles, ovals, square shapes, and free outline; and an immense variety of letter styles, including many designed for the particular device.<br>A notable feature of this volume is the Index of Monograms and Ciphers, listing alphabetically every letter combination shown and the page or pages on which each appears ("S W", for example, is drawn in three different styles; "A L" in five; but "F N H W" in only one); and an Index of Names and Devices. Both features add greatly to the usefulness of the book. Importantly, every device shown may be reproduced by the purchaser free of charge.<br>Artists, designers, engravers, and craftspeople will find this book a prolific source of inspiration and unusual styles; typographers, calligraphers, draftspeople , and students will use it as an aid in creating their own letter designs; while those in the printing, publishing, advertising, and allied fields will call upon it whenever a distinctive monogram or decoration is needed.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Heart of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity</h2><p><p> As the specter of religious extremism has become a fact of life today, the temptation is great to allow the evil actions and perspectives of a minority to represent an entire tradition. In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand. </p> <p> <i>In The Heart of Islam</i> one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to "open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding." Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths. </p> <p> Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. "Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies," he writes, "but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation.</p></p><p><p>Seyyed Hossein Nasr is university professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University. Author of over fifty books, Professor Nasr is a well-known and highly respected intellectual figure both in the West and in the Islamic world. Born in Tehran, raised from the age of twelve in the United States, and a graduate of MIT and Harvard University, Nasr is well qualified to explain Islam to a Western audience. He appears frequently on <em>Meet the Press</em>, as well as other national news shows.</p>&#x201c;This is exactly the right book... to counter the demonizing stereotypes of Islam proliferated by the war on terrorism&#x201d; (Huston Smith, author of The World's Religions)<br><br>&#x201c;Professor Nasr has put the beauty and appeal of Islam into clear and readable English.&#x201d; (John Shelby Spong, author of A New Christianity for a New World)<br><br>&#x201c;This sensitive, insightful and beautifully written book comes as a ray of sunshine.&#x201d; (Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God)<br><br>&#x201c;Filled with challenge and insight...an indispensable text.&#x201d; (Rabbi Michael Paley)<br><br>&#x201c;A lasting, honest, and intimate tour of Islam&#x2019;s basic aspects...&#x201d; (The [New Jersey] Star-Ledger)<br><br>&#x201c;A first-tier Islamic scholar ... it is hard to imagine a better introduction to the faith.&#x201d; (Library Journal)<br><br>&#x201c;[I]t is hard to imagine a better introduction to the faith.&#x201d; (Library Journal)<br><br>&#x201c;An illuminating new book that explores the spiritual and social values of the faith of one-fifth of humanity.&#x201d; (Christian Science Monitor)<br><br>&#x201c;The most important study of Islam in all its breadth and all its depth available in the English language.&#x201d; (Gai Eaton, author of Islam and the Destiny of Man)<br><br>&#x201c;Concise, clear, and eloquent, it has the crystalline ring of the voice of reason and cuts through layers of ignorance.&#x201d; (The World &amp; I)</p><h2>Mazda MX-5 Miata: Find It.

It has one of my all-time favorite heroes. The story is set in eighteenth-century England, an earlier era than my usual Regency setting. I made the change deliberately so that I could dress up my characters in all the splendid plumage of the time. Lucas Kendrick, Duke of Harndon, has just returned from Paris, undisputed center of the fashionable world, having unexpectedly inherited his title and position as head of the family that had spurned and exiled him many years before. Now he has power to wield and old scores to settle, and he looks upon his world with a cold and dangerous cynicism.</p><p>I enjoyed creating that very masculine aspect of his character, but I positively reveled in clothing him in all his Parisian splendor. He attends a ball early in the book in a wide-skirted scarlet coat and a gold waistcoat, both sparkling with gold embroidery, while white lace froths at his neck and wrists. He wears satin knee breeches with white stockings and jeweled shoes with high red heels. His long hair is powdered and crisply curled at the sides and bagged at the back, and he wears cosmetics and carries a fan. But he also carries at his side a jewel-hilted sword with which he is said to be more than ordinarily adept, and for all the languid grace of his manner, there is that look in his eyes&#x2014;a look he soon directs across the ballroom at Lady Anna Marlowe.</p><p>And so begins a passion-fraught love story that kept me pounding the keyboard until they had found their happily-ever-after. I hope you enjoy seeing the two sides of Luke as much as I did creating them. And I hope you consider Anna a worthy heroine for him.</p><p>Mary Balogh</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>&#x201c;FAITH, child,&#x201d; Lady Sterne said to her goddaughter, &#x201c;&#x2019;tis time you gave some thought to yourself. Always it has been your family&#x2014;first your mama, may God rest her soul, and then your papa, may God rest his, and always your brother and the girls. Well, now, Victor is of age and has come into his inheritance, Charlotte has married, Agnes is as pretty as a spring meadow and is like to marry as soon as we have presented her to some eligible gentlemen, and Emily&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, you just cannot make yourself a martyr to your youngest sister. &#x2019;Tis time you looked to your own interests.&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Anna Marlowe smiled and watched her younger sister at the other end of the gallery being fitted out for fashionable clothes suitable to be worn in London. Bolts of fabric, mostly silks and shimmering satins, were piled on tables, some of them partly unrolled. There was some excitement about the scene and about the anticipation of seeing the clothes made and worn, she had to admit.</p><p>&#x201c;Agnes is eighteen, Aunt Marjorie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I am five-and-twenty. On the shelf, one might say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I vow that is where you wish to stay,&#x201d; Lady Sterne said sharply. &#x201c;Life slips by fast, child, and increases in pace as one gets older, I swear. And life can become filled with regrets for what one might have done in the past but did not do. &#x2019;Tis not too late for you to seek a husband, but in another year or two perhaps it will be. Men do not look for breeders among women who are staring thirty years in the face&#x2014;and men of course look for breeders when they choose mates. You have a great deal of love to give, Anna. You should now be looking to giving it to a husband and to receiving love in return&#x2014;and position and security.&#x201d;</p><p>That last point hit home. Victor, Anna&#x2019;s only brother, had recently celebrated his twenty-first birthday. With university days behind him and his title still new to him&#x2014;he had been the Earl of Royce since Papa&#x2019;s death a little more than a year ago&#x2014;he was soon to return home to take up his responsibilities there. And he was newly betrothed. Where did that leave her? Anna wondered. And Agnes and Emily? Suddenly their home did not seem quite home any longer. Not that Victor would turn them out, or Constance for that matter. But one did not like to intrude on a newly married couple in their own home&#x2014;especially not in the status of spinster sister.</p><p>She was a spinster. Anna clasped her hands rather tightly in her lap. But she could not marry. The thought brought with it the familiar shortness of breath and coldness in her head. She fought off the dizziness.</p><p>&#x201c;I brought Agnes to London at your urging, Aunt,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis more likely that she will find an eligible husband here than in the neighborhood of Elm Court. If she can be settled, I will be content.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lud, child,&#x201d; her godmother said, &#x201c;I urged you to <i>bring </i>your sister, not send her. I intended that you both find husbands. But you most of all, Anna. You are my godchild&#x2014;my only one. Agnes is nothing to me except the daughter of my dear Lucy. For although you are all sweet enough to call me aunt, I am no such thing, you know. I see that Madame Delacroix has all but finished with her measurements.&#x201d; She got to her feet. &#x201c;I will have you, too, decked out properly for town, my dear. Excuse my bluntness, but you look quite rustic. Even your hoops&#x2014; they should be twice the size they are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Large hoops look quite ridiculous,&#x201d; Anna said. Ridiculous, but wondrously feminine and pretty, she thought treacherously. And her godmother had just reminded her that there was no real tie between her and Agnes. Could she be expected to take Agnes about to all the social events at which it was to be hoped she would attract a husband? Was not that Anna&#x2019;s responsibility? And would not it be wonderfully exhilarating to dress fashionably and to go about in society just a few times? Just for a short while?</p><p><i>I</i> <i>will return. And of course you will be here when I do so. You will remember, my Anna, that you are mine? Body and soul? </i>The voice was as vivid in her head as if the man who had uttered them stood at her shoulder and spoke the words now. They had been spoken a year ago at Elm Court. A long time ago and a long way away. He would not come back. And even if he did, it would surely do no harm to enjoy herself a little before he did. She was only twenty-five. And really there had been very little enjoyment in her life. Surely just a little.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was not as if she was going to be in search of a husband, after all. She knew very well that she could never marry.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, perhaps,&#x201d; she said, getting to her feet to stand beside Lady Sterne, &#x201c;I could have a few new clothes made so that I will not shame you if I do venture out with you once or twice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lud, child,&#x201d; her godmother said, &#x201c;&#x2019;twould be difficult for you to do that when you have such beauty. Nevertheless, fashion is of importance. Come.&#x201d; She linked her arm through Anna&#x2019;s and moved her forward across the room. &#x201c;Let us proceed before you change your mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Agnes was flushed and bright-eyed and was exclaiming that she could not possibly need all the clothes Madame Delacroix claimed to be the bare essentials for a young lady of quality making her first appearance in society. Anna&#x2019;s heart went out to her sister. She was eighteen years old and had been in mourning for two years&#x2014;first for Mama and then for Papa. Even before that Mama had been ill with consumption and Papa had been&#x2014;well, he had been ill too. And there had been the poverty. There had been very little chance for Agnes to enjoy her youth.</p><p>&#x201c;Lud, child,&#x201d; Lady Sterne said to Agnes, &#x201c;&#x2019;twould not do at all, you know, for you to be seen in the same dresses time and again. Madame knows her job. Besides, she has had strict instructions from me. And now &#x2019;tis Anna&#x2019;s turn.&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Sterne had insisted from the start that she would bear all the expenses of the few months to be spent in London. It would be a dream come true for her, she claimed, to have two young ladies to take about and introduce to society. She had never had children of her own. Anna had brought some money with her&#x2014;Victor had insisted that she take some from the estate though it would be years before he could expect to make it prosper again. And perhaps he never would if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But Anna refused to pursue the thought. She was not going to think about any of that for a month or two. She was going to give herself a chance to heal a little. She had told her godmother that she would keep a strict account of all that was spent on her and Agnes, that she would consider it a loan to be repaid when she was able.</p><p>And so, after all, she found herself being taken into the capable hands of Madame Delacroix and measured and poked and prodded and pricked and draped. It seemed that she stood still for hours while discussing with the two older ladies fabrics and trimmings and designs for petticoats, stomachers, open gowns, closed gowns, sack dresses&#x2014;it was all very dizzying. She was laced into stays far tighter than she was accustomed to and looked down in some embarrassment&#x2014;and some fascination&#x2014;at the way they pushed up her breasts, making them seem larger and more feminine. And she was tied into whalebone hoops so wide that she wondered how she would pass through doorways.</p><p>She enjoyed every moment.</p><p>How wonderful it was, she thought, to feel young and free. Not that she was either in reality. Youth had passed her by. And as for freedom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well. She felt slightly nauseated for a moment when she remembered how very much she was not free. If <i>he </i>should come back from America as he had sworn he would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But she was not trying to break free forever. Merely for a couple of months. Surely he would not begrudge her that much time even if he knew about it.</p><p>How wonderful it would be to feel youthful and free for two whole months.</p><p>&#x201c;I vow, child,&#x201d; Lady Sterne said when the fitting was finally over, &#x201c;the years are falling off you by the minute. You have had a hard time and have remained devoted to your family throughout. Now is the time for yourself. And &#x2019;tis not too late. As I live, I am going to find you a very special husband.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna laughed. &#x201c;&#x2019;Twill be enough to attend a few balls and concerts, Aunt,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I will remember it all for a lifetime. I have no need of a husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pshaw!&#x201d; said her godmother briskly.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>&#x201c;Egad, but you made us all look like bumpkins tonight, lad,&#x201d; Theodore, Lord Quinn said, slapping his thigh with delight as he seated himself in a deep chair in his nephew&#x2019;s library and took a glass of brandy from a valet&#x2019;s hand before the man was dismissed. He laughed heartily. &#x201c;&#x2019;Twas the fan that really slayed &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>Lucas Kendrick, Duke of Harndon, was neither drinking nor sitting. He stood elegantly propped against the marble mantel. He raised the fan to which his uncle had just referred, a small ivory and gold affair, and opened it to waft it languidly in front of his face. &#x201c;It serves to cool one&#x2019;s brow in a warm room,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It has a purely practical function, my dear.&#x201d;</p><p>His uncle was in a mood to be amused. He laughed afresh. &#x201c;Pox on it, Luke,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;&#x2019;tis pure affectation as are the powder and rouge and patches.&#x201d;</p><p>His nephew raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;You would have me appear in society half naked, Theo?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not me, lad,&#x201d; Lord Quinn said. He took a sizable mouthful from his glass, savored it for a few moments on his tongue and then swallowed. &#x201c;I have spent time in Paris and know how men dress and behave there. Though even there, as I remember, you have a reputation for leading fashion rather than following it. &#x2019;Tis perhaps a good thing that you also have a reputation as a deadly shot and swordsman, or it might almost be thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; The clear gray eyes of his nephew narrowed slightly and the fan stilled in his hands. &#x201c;What might almost be thought?&#x201d;</p><p>But his uncle merely laughed and looked him over from head to toe with leisurely appreciation. His amused eyes took in the powdered hair neatly set into two rolls on either side of the head, the long hair caught behind into a black silk bag and tied in a large bow at the nape of his neck&#x2014;it was his own hair, not a wig&#x2014;the austerely handsome face with its dusting of powder and blush of rouge and one black patch; the dark blue silk coat with its full skirts and silver lining and lavish silver embroidery and facings; the silver waistcoat with blue embroidery; the tight gray knee breeches and white silk stockings; the silver-buckled shoes with their high red heels. The Duke of Harndon was the very epitome of Parisian splendor. And then, of course, there was the dress sword at his side with its sapphire-jeweled hilt, a weapon with which his grace was said to be more than ordinarily adept.</p><p>&#x201c;I refuse to answer, lad,&#x201d; Lord Quinn said at last, &#x201c;on the grounds that I do not fancy having the tip of that sword poking out from my backbone. But it was kind of you to leave White&#x2019;s Club early tonight. You will be the topic of conversation there for the rest of the night, I warrant you.&#x201d; He chuckled once more. &#x201c;The fan, Luke. Zounds, but I swear Jessop very near swallowed his port, glass and all, when you first drew it out and opened it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you will remember, Theo,&#x201d; Luke said, fanning himself again, not participating in the laughter, &#x201c;I left Paris with the greatest reluctance. You talked me into it. But I&#x2019;ll be damned before you also talk me into becoming the typical English gentleman, stalking about my land with ill-fitting frock coat and staff in hand and hounds at heel and English ale in my stomach and English oaths on my lips. Don&#x2019;t expect it of me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hark ye, Luke,&#x201d; his uncle said, suddenly serious. &#x201c;If I had to persuade you to come back home, &#x2019;twas only because you would not take the responsibility on your own shoulders and everything is like to go to wrack and ruin at Bowden Abbey in your absence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; the Duke of Harndon said coldly, &#x201c;I do not care the snap of two fingers what happens to Bowden Abbey and all who live there, Theo. I have done well enough without them for the past ten years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nay, lad,&#x201d; his uncle said, &#x201c;I know you better than most. Cold you may appear to be when you are not charming the ladies and coaxing the most lovely of them into your bed, and cold you may have the right to be after the unjust way you were treated. But I know that the Luke of ten years ago is still in large measure the Luke of today. You care, lad. Besides, there is such a thing as responsibility. You are the Duke of Harndon now and have been for two years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never looked for such a position,&#x201d; Luke said, &#x201c;or expected it, Theo. There was George older than me, and George married ten years ago.&#x201d; There was something resembling a sneer in his voice for a moment. &#x201c;One might have expected there to be male issue in the eight years before his death.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; his uncle said. &#x201c;But there was only the one son, stillborn, Luke.

He&#39;s going far away, &#39;as far from home as I can go.&#39; But when it starts to get dark, Little Mouse has second thoughts: maybe home wasn&#39;t such a bad place after all! Good thing there&#39;s a phone booth nearby.Robert Kraus is the author of <em>Little Louie the Baby Bloomer</em> and <em>Leo the Late Bloomer,</em> illustrated by Jose Aruego, and the author and illustrator of dozens of books for children.<br><br><p>Jose Aruego&#x2019;s books for young readers have earned the applause of critics, teachers, librarians, and parents&#x2014;as well as the affection of children everywhere. Mr. Aruego&#x2019;s comic animals are immediately recognizable as they cavort through clear, vibrant landscapes, carrying out the action that the simple text has set in motion. It is a style one reviewer has termed &#x201c;illustrative mime.&#x201d;</p><p>Jose Aruego was born in the Philippines, where he studied law. But after practicing briefly, he decided to come to the United States to study graphic arts and advertising at Parsons School of Design in New York City. After graduation, he worked in advertising before taking up the demanding job of cartooning for <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Look</em>, and other magazines.</p><p>Mr. Aruego said: &#x201c;Every Wednesday I would go to the cartoon editor with fifteen or sixteen drawings in hand, from which he might select one for publication. The tension was terrible, because selling cartoons was how I made my living. But I learned a lot from the rejected work, so it wasn&#x2019;t a waste. The sink-or-swim experience of drawing cartoons was how I learned to make the most of a small amount of space.&#x201d; Both abilities have helped him in his career as a children&#x2019;s book author and illustrator, which he began with the publication of <em>The King and His Friends</em> in 1969.</p><p>Although he is known for his amusing characters, Jose Aruego takes writing and drawing for children very seriously. After more than three dozen books he feels he is still learning his craft and getting to know his audience. From the popularity and appeal of Jose Aruego&#x2019;s books, it is obvious that he has both the artistic skill and the imagination to reach the world of children. His work has a distinctive rhythm, and his humorous animal characters have a gaiety and playfulness that children adore.</p><p>&#x201c;Each project teaches me something new and makes me a better artist. Each book brings me closer to children,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have found from making appearances at schools that when kids draw for themselves, most of them like to make funny pictures. So I show them how to draw an alligator. It&#x2019;s a simple drawing and the teachers tell me that after my visit, Aruego alligators show up all over the school.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>As a team, Ariane Dewey and Jose Aruego have illustrated over sixty children's books, including <em>Little Louie the Baby Bloomer</em> and <em>Leo the Late Bloomer</em>. She lives in New York City.</p> <p><b>In Her Own Words...</b></p><p>"My very first memory is of dark blue walls and off-white trim. My mother confirms this unusual baby-girl&#x2019;s-room color scheme in the house where I lived until age one. Possibly this is why one of my favorite colors is darkish blue-jean blue. The other is brilliant orange.</p><p>"As a child I pored over Chicago&#x2019;s Shedd Aquarium catalog of exotically colored fish that seemed too gaudy to be real. My mother and I looked through art books and then sketched portraits of each other or painted watercolors of the armloads of wildflowers we picked. We still love to discuss the subtle juxtapositions of the colorful scenes and objects around us.</p><p>"Art was the most enjoyable part of school. I liked to squish gobs of finger paint on wet paper, or to write, illustrate, and bind stories into books, or, best of all, to paint stage sets for the school plays. I began to look at whatever I saw in terms of which medium&#x2014;oil, pastel, collage, watercolor&#x2014;would best catch the mood and texture before me. At Sarah Lawrence College I majored in painting and sculpture. After graduation I couldn't find an auto body shop willing to lend me space to work on welded sculptures. So I got a job with an industrial design firm doing picture research, among other more mundane tasks, and later became an art editor for a textbook publisher.</p><p>"Soon after that I began writing and illustrating books for children with Jose Aruego, whimsical books with his clever lines and my vivid colors. Jose draws and I paint. We have illustrated some sixty books together, some of which we have also written. Critics have been kind, but, more important, children have been enthusiastic both in the United States and in the many foreign countries where our books have been published.</p><p>"My fingers finally became itchy to do my own drawings, so I started by retelling and illustrating the stories I loved best as a child. A mini-series of regional American tall tales enabled me to indulge my sense of the absurd. These heros and heroines are offbeat, upbeat, irreverent, hilarious, and a lot of fun to draw. Since I also love research, I delight in taking on nonfiction subjects and handling them with fantasy. Color is the basis of my art, while writing and drawing help to describe my colorful visions.</p><p>"Whatever the subject, I want my readers to stretch their imaginations, to see with their minds&#x2019; eyes what happens between one picture and the next. I want to make them explore and smile.</p><p>"I live in New York City with my husband, Claus Dannasch."</p></p><h2>A Rule Against Murder (Thorndike Mystery)</h2><p><p>It is the height of summer, and Armand Gamache and his wife are celebrating their wedding anniversary at an isolated, luxurious inn not far from the village of Three Pines.

After Guatemala's bloody thirty-six years of civil war (1960&#x2013;1996), silence and impunity reigned. That is, until 2005, when human rights investigators stumbled on the archives of the country's National Police, which, at 75 million pages, proved to be the largest trove of secret state records ever found in Latin America.<p></p><p>The unearthing of the archives renewed fierce debates about history, memory, and justice. In <i>Paper Cadavers</i>, Weld explores Guatemala's struggles to manage this avalanche of evidence of past war crimes, providing a firsthand look at how postwar justice activists worked to reconfigure terror archives into implements of social change. Tracing the history of the police files as they were transformed from weapons of counterinsurgency into tools for post-conflict reckoning, Weld sheds light on the country's fraught transition from war to an uneasy peace, reflecting on how societies forget and remember political violence.</p></p><p><p>Kirsten Weld is Assistant Professor of History at Harvard University.</p>&#x201c;The book Weld has written, entitled <i>Paper Cadavers: Archives of Dictatorship in Guatemala</i>, is brilliant and engrossing, told with the passion the topic deserves.... A study of surveillance and secrecy and of the courageous few that expose that power, <i>Paper Cadavers</i> is a book for us all.&#x201d; (Deborah T. Levenson <i>Revista: Harvard Review of Latin America</i>)<br><br>"Weld&#x2019;s chronicle of their efforts is extraordinary, less about an archive as a historical information source and far more about an archive as a subject, a history-maker in its own right." (Brian Bethune <i>Maclean's</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;One of the most compelling sections of the volume is Weld&#x2019;s interviews with volunteers who worked in the archives and their motivations for doing so, including coming to terms with the experiences of disappeared relatives and friends. A thoughtful addition to the emerging discussion on understanding archives in the wake of human rights violations of repressive regimes. Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates and above.&#x201d; (E. A. Novara <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What Weld offers is an updated, much more compelling and theoretically sophisticated case study of why popular historical knowledge and struggles over archives matter so much and the role a politically engaged scholar might play in the process.&#x201d; (Julie A. Gibbings <i>Canadian Journal of History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Paper Cadavers</i> is not a compilation of the archives' contents but rather a meditation on the relationship between archives and national history, accompanied by an account of the transformation of a rotting warehouse into the scene for writing history, and an exploration of the perceptions of the people who carried out this work. . . . [B]rilliant and essential. . . .&#x201d; (Stephen Henighan <i>Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies</i>)<br><br>"'Essential reading' is an apt way to sum up <i>Paper Cadavers</i>. The book weaves together issues of transitional justice, human rights, historical memory, and state terror. Rich in original insight, it is of equal use to scholars and students and promises to be much cited and assigned."&nbsp; (J. T. Way <i>Hispanic American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In a sense, Weld&#x2019;s book isn&#x2019;t really about history at all. It&#x2019;s a book about a country that&#x2019;s been run badly off the rails, where every day is characterized by appalling violence, impunity, and by state institutions that are either, as she puts it, &#x201c;totally ineffectual or deeply enmeshed in organized crime.&#x201d; But what you can&#x2019;t help but wonder, thanks to Weld&#x2019;s insightful and engrossing work, is how much better Guatemala&#x2019;s situation might now be if it hadn&#x2019;t lost generations of student leaders, trade unionists, intellectuals and idealists, the very kinds of people it needs to face its intractable problems.&#x201d; (Peter Canby <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Future historians who consult the PN archives will benefit immensely from this fine-grained anatomy of it; more broadly, scholars of Latin America and other regions, too, will learn much from <i>Paper Cadavers</i>, particularly as they ponder how the production and organization of their sources affects their scholarship.&#x201d;</p> (David Carey Jr. <i>Ethnohistory</i>)<br><br>"Weld&#x2019;s publication is a serious contribution to archival literature. Weld places front and centre the activities carried out within the archival walls in human rights struggles. While this is about the police archives of Guatemala, it is also about archives in general and the sometimes strained and tenuous positions in which they find themselves in relation to the powers that fund, operate, and sanction them. Even for archivists who have visited the country or who live there, not only is it reaffirming to examine archival practice and theories in a very real world setting, seeing the challenges and benefits of our professional process through this particular lens, but it is also revelatory of our own subjectivity in what we do.&#x201d; (Heather Home <i>Archivaria</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Weld's skillfully deployed &#x2018;dialectical&#x2019; method makes a compelling case that historical research on such questions cannot take the constitution of the archive itself for granted. She has inspired us to explore the historical processes underlying the creation of the data we collect, while reflecting critically on the relationship between this data (including that which might have existed) and the core values that drive our research.&#x201d; (Charles Hale <i>American Historical Review</i>)</p><h2>Stephen Wilkes. Day to Night</h2><p><p>If you were to stand in one spot at an iconic location for 30 hours and simply observe, never closing your eyes, you still wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take in all the detail and emotion found in a Stephen Wilkes panoramic photograph. Not only does Wilkes shoot over 1,500 exposures from a fixed angle, he also distills this visual information afterward in his studio, painstakingly composing selected frames into a single image.Day to Night presents 60 epic panoramas created between 2009 and 2018, shot everywhere from Africa&#x2019;s Serengeti to the Champs-�lys�es in Paris, from the Grand Canyon to Coney Island, from Trafalgar Square to Red Square. Each composition is a labor of love as well as patience. Wilkes waited more than two years to gain permission to photograph Pope Francis celebrating Easter mass in the Vatican, ultimately producing a vivid tableau in which the pontiff appears 10 times.</p><p>The book also features extraordinary details&#x2015;works of art in their own right that highlight the stories contained within each image. A bride makes her way through Central Park; in Tanzania, zebras gather around a near-invisible watering hole during a drought; in Rio de Janeiro, surfers come and go while a man holds a sign reading &#x201c;No more than two questions per customer.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is exactly these small stories, these details, that draw people into the photographs,&#x201d; says Wilkes. Once discovered, these mini narratives lend each composition a personal, candid feel.</p><p>This collection takes us on a seamless trip from dawn to dark across the world&#x2019;s most iconic locations, unveiling the unique ebb and flow of man-made and natural landmarks like never before.Also available in two Art Editions of 100 copies respectively, each with a print numbered and signed by the photographer.</p></p><p>Lyle Rexer is a New York&#x2013;based writer, curator, and art critic.

How can a ninety-pound woman carry a massive air conditioner to the second floor of her home, install it in a window unassisted, and then not remember how it got there? Why would a brilliant feminist law student ask her fianc� to treat her like a helpless little girl? How can an ordinary, violence-fearing businessman once have been a gun-packing vigilante prowling the crime districts for a fight?<br><br>A startling new study in human consciousness, <b>The Myth of Sanity</b> is a landmark book about forgotten trauma, dissociated mental states, and multiple personality in everyday life. In its groundbreaking analysis of childhood trauma and dissociation and their far-reaching implications in adult life, it reveals that moderate dissociation is a normal mental reaction to pain and that even the most extreme dissociative reaction-multiple personality-is more common than we think. Through astonishing stories of people whose lives have been shattered by trauma and then remade, <b>The Myth of Sanity</b> shows us how to recognize these altered mental states in friends and family, even in ourselves.</p><p>No one likes being called crazy. But Dr. Martha Stout, a psychological trauma specialist, invites all to question their own level of mental acumen in <i>The Myth of Sanity</i>. Her logic makes sense: all humans experience fear, especially during youth; individuals' response systems determine how their brains catalogue traumatic experiences and trigger "dissociative" coping strategies. Those who experience horrific situations like abuse, catastrophe, or grueling medical procedures fare the worst over time; their dissociative behaviors can manifest themselves as situational fatigue, "lost" hours or days, or split personalities. <p> Drawing from 20 years of treating such patients, Stout presents several composite characters to illustrate all levels of dissociative behavior: from the very serious DID (dissociative identity disorder, or "switching" among distinct personalities) to the nearly universal "brief phasing out" (losing a thought or getting "caught up" in something). As each patient undergoes psychoanalysis, Stout highlights clues for identifying trauma sufferers and lends advice to their loved ones. Tending away from scientific data or supportive research findings--while tending toward a fiction-lover's prose--<i>The Myth of Sanity</i> focuses on personal stories and Stout's zealous admiration for responsible therapy patients who wake to a sanity unclouded by past fears. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>TALES OF MULTIPLE PERSONALITY IN EVERYDAY LIFE</p><h2>The Psychology of Superheroes: An Unauthorized Exploration (Psychology of Popular Culture)</h2><p>This latest installment in the Psychology of Popular Culture series turns its focus to superheroes.

It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Victor Hugo's flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the <br>day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Mis�rables, which Hugo would write thirty years later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral. The inscription had been eradicated by the time the book was published, and Hugo feared that Notre-Dame's Gothic splendor might soon be lost to the contemporary fad for tearing down old buildings. Notre-Dame has survived as one of the great monuments of Paris, and Hugo's novel is a fitting celebration of it, a popular classic that is proving to be just as enduring.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.

The first chronological survey covering all art forms from colonial times to the present to publish in over a decade, it explores issues of racial identity and representation in artistic expression, while also emphasizing aesthetics and visual analysis to help students develop an understanding and appreciation of African-American art that is informed but not entirely defined by racial identity. Through a carefully selected collection of creative works and accompanying analyses, the text also addresses crucial gaps in the scholarly literature, incorporating women artists from the beginning and including coverage of photography, crafts, and architecture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as well as twenty-first century developments. All in all, <em>African American Art: A Visual and Cultural History </em>offers a fresh and compelling look at the great variety of artistic expression found in the African-American community.<br><br>Visit <strong>www.oup.com/us/farrington</strong> for additional support material, including chapter outlines, study questions, links to artists' sites, and other resources to help students succeed.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lisa Farrington </strong>is the founding Chair of the Art &amp; Music Department at the City University of New York's John Jay College.

The coverage and methodology are an improvement over the text I currently use." <br>--Alison Fleming, <em>Winston-Salem State University</em><p></p><br>"<em>African-American Art</em> integrates styles and artists within the visual culture of the times in which they were created. This allows readers to gain new insights into the way these artists tried to advance their work beyond racial constrictions, labeling, and expectations. As the first new survey of African-American art published in fifteen years, it is certainly welcome in my course." <br>--Naurice Frank Woods, <em>University of North Carolina, Greensboro</em><p></p><br>"This book will open students' eyes to an incredible range of material and give them a sense of the possibilities for future research. It couches all of this within a highly sophisticated and contemporary methodological framework. <em>African-American Art</em> features more African-American female artists than any previous survey. It engages with traditionally marginalized artistic expressions like architecture. And perhaps, most importantly, it sustains an effort to situate African-American art within mainstream artistic movements so as to critique the very use of 'race' as a methodological framework for African-American art." <br>-- Paul B.

Today, more than half of the global population&#x2014;3.7 billion people&#x2014;are urban dwellers, and that number is expected to double by 2050. There is no question that cities are growing; the only debate is over how they will grow. Will we invest in the physical and social infrastructure necessary for livable, equitable, and sustainable cities?&nbsp;In the latest edition of <i>State of the World</i>, the flagship publication of the Worldwatch Institute, experts from around the globe examine the core principles of sustainable urbanism and profile cities that are putting them into practice.<br><br><i>State of the World</i> first puts our current moment in context, tracing cities in the arc of human history. It also examines the basic structural elements of every city: materials and fuels; people and economics; and biodiversity.&nbsp;In part two, professionals working on some of the world&#x2019;s most inventive urban sustainability projects share their first-hand experience. Success stories come from places as diverse as Ahmedabad, India; Freiburg, Germany; and Shanghai, China. In many cases, local people are acting to improve their cities, even when national efforts are stalled.&nbsp;Parts three and four examine cross-cutting issues that affect the success of all cities. Topics range from the nitty-gritty of handling waste and developing public transportation to civic participation and navigating dysfunctional government.<br><br> Throughout, readers discover the most pressing challenges facing communities and the most promising solutions currently being developed. The result is a snapshot of cities today and a vision for global urban sustainability tomorrow. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The latest volume of the Worldwach Institute's flagship publication,&nbsp;<i>State of the World </i>examines the core principles of sustainable urbanism.&nbsp;Through research and outreach that inspire action, the Worldwatch Institute works to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world that meets human needs.

Based on a theory of empowered stakeholders, this bestselling text argues that the responsibility of a corporation is to create value, broadly defined. The primary challenge for managers today is to balance the competing interests of the firm&#x2019;s stakeholders, understanding that what they expect today may not be what they will expect tomorrow. This tension is what makes CSR so complex and demanding, but it is also what makes CSR integral to the firm&#x2019;s strategy and day-to-day operations.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br> <br> The new edition includes the latest research, new cases, a streamlined table of contents, and expanded emphasis on the legal perspective of strategic CSR. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Keep your course content up-to-date! &nbsp; </strong><br> Subscribe to David Chandler&#x2032;s &#x2032;CSR Newsletters&#x2032; by e-mailing him at david.chandler@ucdenver.edu.

Casting a new light on American empire, <i>Badges Without Borders</i> shows, for the first time, that the very same people charged with global counterinsurgency also militarized American policing at home.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this groundbreaking expos�, Stuart Schrader shows how the United States projected imperial power overseas through police training and technical assistance--and how this effort reverberated to shape the policing of city streets at home. Examining diverse records, from recently declassified national security and intelligence materials to police textbooks and professional magazines, Schrader reveals how U.S. police leaders envisioned the beat to be as wide as the globe and worked to put everyday policing at the core of the Cold War project of counterinsurgency. A "smoking gun" book, <i>Badges Without Borders </i>offers a new account of the War on Crime, "law and order" politics, and global counterinsurgency, revealing the connections between foreign and domestic racial control.</p><p>"Stuart Schrader's&nbsp;<i>Badges without Borders</i>&nbsp;is a stunning achievement. A conceptual&nbsp;<i>tour de force</i>&nbsp;that simultaneously combines political theory, sociology, and social history, Schrader's book examines how the United States pioneered a kind of professional carceral internationalism. The United States has long resisted scholarly efforts at categorical definition. How, after all, does one study a nation with borders but no boundaries? Schrader shows us how."--Greg Grandin, author of&nbsp;<i>The End of Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America</i><br><br>"Schrader's superb and finely written book shows beyond any doubt that US law enforcement deliberately policed its own citizens like the military did Cold War 'enemies' elsewhere. Deemed counterinsurgents in both contexts,&nbsp;<i>Badges Without Borders</i>&nbsp;illustrates precisely how the military industrial complex and the prison industrial complex came together through law enforcement in an attempt to crush anti-racist and anti-colonial activists here and abroad. Everything from riot control to stop and frisk policing and the use of military-grade weapons in U.S. cities have their roots in national security policy. In this excellent work of history, the archives finally reveal just how right Baldwin was to call Harlem 'occupied territory.'"--Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of&nbsp;<i>The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America</i><br><br>"Going beyond the lament of police militarization,&nbsp;<i>Badges Without Borders</i>&nbsp;weaves together domestic policing and foreign military occupation in a single--and singularly powerful--history of global order maintenance. More than a beautifully crafted, fine-grained history of police modernization, this book's history of terror reminds us of a critical lesson: U.S. elites built the arsenal of oppression against subversives and revolutionaries by working across national boundaries. Liberation will require the same."--Naomi Murakawa, author of&nbsp;<i>The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America</i>"<i>Badges Without Borders</i>&nbsp;reveals the way American bureaucrats promoted professionalization of policing as a counterinsurgency strategy abroad, and then drew upon their experience to manage urban unrest at home. Fascinating and deeply researched, it makes crucial contributions to the history of security practices and the US role in the world."--Mary L. Dudziak, author of&nbsp;<i>War Time: An Idea, Its History, Its Consequences</i><br><br>"Schrader's elegant, compelling, and eye-opening narrative, bursting with a palpable urgency, shows us that coercive policing in America's streets has always been tightly interwoven with American-sponsored state violence abroad, whether in Vietnam, Brazil, or Guatemala. With this book, we can never look at policing in America in the same way again. No consideration of policing today can proceed without taking it into account."--Julian Go, author of&nbsp;<i>Patterns of Empire: the British and American Empires, 1688 to Present</i>&nbsp;<br><br>"In this eloquently written and persuasive book, Schrader makes many original and generative contributions to scholarship and civic life. He presents telling critiques of what have become shibboleths of the left: about the Cold War as an alleged boon to anti-racism, about viewing domestic police work and overseas military operations as unconnected, and about the presumed innocence of liberals and liberalism in the construction and maintenance of racist subordination.--George Lipsitz, author of&nbsp;<i>How Racism Takes Place&nbsp;</i></p><h2>The Frantic Assembly Book of Devising Theatre: Book of Devising Theatre</h2><p><p>&#x2018;This is a close companion to Frantic Assembly&#x2019;s practice and one that is written with an open and engaging, even disarming, tone ...

Unlike so many chefs, cooking&#x2019;s not a job to him. It&#x2019;s a joy. And you feel that every time he slips behind a stove.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Ruth Reichl</b></p><p><b>Curtis Stone</b> is an internationally known chef, award-winning restaurateur, TV host, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author. Born in Melbourne, Australia, Curtis first found his passion for food while watching his grandmother, Maude, make her legendary fudge. After completing culinary school, he took a job at the Savoy Hotel in Melbourne before heading to London, where he honed his skills under legendary three-star Michelin genius, Marco Pierre White. While living in London, Curtis appeared in several U.K. cooking shows before catching the eye of television producers in Australia and the United States. Curtis hosts and appears on numerous primetime television shows, including his most recent project as mentor on Food Network&#x2019;s hit show <i>All-Star Academy</i>. Coming full circle, Curtis opened his first solo restaurant, Maude (named after his grandmother), in Beverly Hills in February 2014. Maude has received rave reviews from the James Beard Foundation (Best New Restaurant semifinalist), <i>Time</i>/<i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i> (one of the best new restaurants in the world), <i>Eater LA</i> (2014&#x2019;s Restaurant of the Year), <i>LA Weekly</i> (2014&#x2019;s Best New Restaurant), <i>Los Angeles Magazine</i> (four out of four stars), <i>Angeleno,</i> and more.Chapter 1<br> LIGHT MEALS<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Roasted Beet and Quinoa Salad with Goat Cheese,<br> Fennel, and Pecans<br> Grilled Vegetable Salad with Curry-Yogurt Vinaigrette<br> Baja Salad<br> Fris�e and Apple Salad with Ale Vinaigrette and Rye Cro�tes<br> Weeknight Navy Bean and Ham Soup<br> Homemade Chicken Soup Makes Me Feel Better<br> Quick Curry Noodle Soup<br> Creamy Celery Root Soup<br> Posole<br> Seafood Stew with Cream and Fennel<br> Roast Chicken Sandwich with Giardiniera<br> Pan Bagnat<br> Veggie Flatbread Sandwich with Feta-Yogurt Spread<br> Pork Burger with Spicy Ginger Pickles<br> &nbsp;<br> I can think of no better way to spend my time than sharing a home-cooked meal with family and good mates. The food, people, setting, time of day, music played, and cocktails mixed make every gathering an occasion. However, I do like to kick back on the couch every now and then, and tuck into a well-made sandwich or satisfying salad. Whether it&#x2019;s a light flatbread sandwich stuffed with summer&#x2019;s crispest cucumbers and sweetest tomatoes or a fris�e and apple salad in the fall, there&#x2019;s something about eating barefoot and almost horizontal on the sofa that feels particularly indulgent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The soups, salads, and sandwiches in this chapter are perfect for an impromptu sofa snack or quick lunch. I also like to mix &#x2019;n&#x2019; match a couple to create a larger casual meal. And they&#x2019;re great for &#x201c;cheating dinners&#x201d; too. I&#x2019;m a big dinner guy; I love my roast chickens, pork shoulders, and lamb rag�s (look out for these bad boys in the Dinners chapter), but occasionally I &#x201c;cheat&#x201d; on them and go with light &#x2019;n&#x2019; delicious when the night calls for it. After a day rushing between the office and a meeting, and finishing off on the line at the restaurant, sometimes all I want to do is reheat a homemade soup, reawakening all of those yummy fresh flavors. Most of the soups included here can be made at least a day ahead. Humble and healthful soups like chicken or navy bean and ham are our go-to for chilly weeknights, but you&#x2019;ll find that many of the soups and a lot of the salads and sandwiches have something extra&#x2014;like the luscious, thick texture and holiday flavors in the Creamy Celery Root Soup or the medley of colorful ingredients and the cilantro dressing in the Baja Salad&#x2014;making them ideal for casual dinner parties too.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roasted Beet and Quinoa Salad with Goat Cheese, Fennel, and Pecans<br> &nbsp;<br> The tarragon vinaigrette used here coats and clings to the grains of quinoa, infusing them with plenty of tangy flavor. I love the way the pecans interplay with the nuttiness of the grain. Farro, spelt, bulgur, and even wild or brown rice also work nicely in this salad.<br> &nbsp;<br> SERVES: 6<br> PREP TIME: 15 minutes<br> COOK TIME: 1 hour<br> MAKE-AHEAD: The beets and quinoa can be cooked up to 1 day ahead, covered separately, and refrigerated.<br> &nbsp;<br> BEETS AND QUINOA<br> 2 pounds small beets (about 2 inches in diameter), scrubbed and trimmed<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup red quinoa, rinsed<br> &nbsp;<br> SALAD AND VINAIGRETTE<br> 3 tablespoons champagne vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 cups (not packed) baby arugula<br> 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and shaved on a vegetable slicer or mandoline<br> � cup pecans, toasted and very coarsely broken<br> 4 ounces soft goat cheese<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. To roast the beets, preheat the oven to 350�F.<br> 2. Place the beets in a roasting pan or baking dish, rub them with 1 tablespoon of the oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover the pan tightly with foil and roast the beets for about 1 hour, or until they are just tender. Cool slightly.<br> 3. Meanwhile, to cook the quinoa, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the quinoa and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes, or until the quinoa is toasted. Add 1&#x2154; cups water and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the quinoa has absorbed the liquid and is tender. Turn off the heat, uncover the pan, and cool completely.<br> 4. When the beets are cool enough to handle, using a towel, rub off the skin. Cut each beet into 6 wedges and place in a medium bowl.<br> 5. To make the vinaigrette, in a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, shallots, oil, and tarragon to blend. Season the vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Add 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette to the cooked beets and toss to coat. Let stand for 30 minutes.<br> 6. In a large bowl, toss the arugula and fennel with enough of the vinaigrette to coat lightly. Season with salt.<br> 7. Mound the quinoa on a platter. Top with the arugula and fennel and then with the beets. Scatter the pecans over the salad and crumble the cheese over it. Drizzle with the remaining vinaigrette and serve immediately.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grilled Vegetable Salad with Curry-Yogurt Vinaigrette<br> &nbsp;<br> The tender arugula and grilled zucchini and peppers carry the curry flavors to create a comforting summer salad. For a heartier meal, serve on a bed of couscous with a couple of Grilled Lamb Chops. The yogurt vinaigrette also tastes incredible spooned over roasted heirloom curried carrots and topped with a handful of toasted pine nuts&#x2014;serve as a side.<br> &nbsp;<br> SERVES: 8<br> PREP TIME: 15 minutes<br> COOK TIME: 8 minutes<br> MAKE-AHEAD: The vinaigrette can be made up to 1 hour ahead, covered, and refrigerated.<br> &nbsp;<br> CURRY-YOGURT VINAIGRETTE<br> � cup plain Greek yogurt<br> � cup finely chopped fresh mint<br> � small red onion, very finely chopped (� cup)<br> 1� teaspoons grated lime zest<br> � cup fresh lime juice<br> 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br> Kosher salt<br> &nbsp;<br> SALAD<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon curry powder<br> 2 pounds medium zucchini, cut lengthwise in half<br> 2 red bell peppers, cored, quartered, and seeded<br> Kosher salt<br> 2� cups (not packed) baby arugula<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. To make the vinaigrette, in a bowl, whisk the yogurt, mint, onion, lime zest and juice, and vinegar to blend. Season to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.<br> 2. To make the salad, prepare a grill for high heat.<br> 3. In a large bowl or on a large platter, mix the oil and curry powder together. Add the zucchini and bell peppers and toss and turn to coat. Season with salt and toss again. Grill the zucchini and bell peppers for about 3 minutes per side, or until just charred but still firm. Transfer the grilled vegetables to a baking sheet and set aside to cool slightly, or let cool to room temperature.<br> 4. Cut the zucchini on a slight angle into 1-inch-wide slices. Cut the bell peppers into �-inch-wide strips. Return the zucchini and bell peppers to the baking sheet.<br> 5. Just before serving, scatter the arugula over the grilled vegetables and use your hands to gently toss the vegetables and arugula with enough vinaigrette to coat lightly. Season the salad to taste with salt. Transfer the salad to a platter or individual plates, spoon a little more vinaigrette around the salad, and serve immediately.<br> &nbsp;<br> VARIATION To roast the zucchini and bell peppers in the oven, preheat the oven to 450�F. Cut the bell peppers into 2-inch pieces, then prepare the zucchini and bell peppers as in step 3 and transfer cut side down to a heavy baking sheet. Roast for about 12 minutes, or until the vegetables are just charred but still firm. Slice the zucchini but keep the bell peppers as large pieces.<br> &nbsp;<br> Baja Salad<br> &nbsp;<br> Just looking at this colorful salad makes me want to dust off my surfboard and hit the Baja California coast. With succulent tomatoes, pickled red onions, crispy tortilla chips, and lime juice, it packs a zing and a crunch. Enjoy it as is; top with braised or grilled pork, beef, or chicken for a more substantial meal; or serve with a side of Humble Beans.<br> &nbsp;<br> SERVES: 6<br> PREP TIME: 30 minutes<br> MAKE-AHEAD: The dressing can be made up to 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.<br> &nbsp;<br> CILANTRO DRESSING<br> � cup packed fresh cilantro leaves<br> 1 garlic clove<br> 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br> 2 tablespoons liquid from the Pickled Red Onions (recipe follows)<br> � cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt<br> &nbsp;<br> SALAD<br> 3 cups coarsely torn romaine lettuce heart (from 1 head)<br> 1� cups shaved green cabbage<br> 4 radishes, cut into matchstick-size strips<br> 1 carrot, cut into matchstick-size strips<br> 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved<br> Kosher salt<br> Pickled Red Onions (recipe follows)<br> 2 small avocados, halved, pitted, peeled, and cut into large chunks (about 2 cups)<br> � cup coarsely crumbled Cotija cheese or feta cheese<br> 3 tablespoons toasted shelled pumpkin seeds (pepitas)<br> About 1� cups Homemade Tortilla Chips, coarsely crumbled<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. To make the dressing, in a small food processor, process the cilantro, garlic, lime juice, and liquid from the pickled onions until the garlic is minced and the cilantro is finely chopped. With the machine running, slowly pour in the oil, processing until the dressing is well blended. Season with salt.<br> 2. Just before serving, in a large wide bowl or on a platter, gently toss the romaine, cabbage, radishes, carrot, and tomatoes with enough dressing to coat. Season with salt. Drain the pickled onions and scatter them over the salad. Top with the diced avocados, Cotija, pumpkin seeds, and crumbled tortilla chips. Serve immediately.</p><h2>The Best of James Taylor</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions). 9 of his best, including: Carolina on My Mind * Don&#39;t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight * Fire and Rain * Long Ago and Far Away * Steamroller * You Can Close Your Eyes * and more.</p><p></p><h2>Everyday Bible Promises for Women</h2><p><b>A Refreshing Blend of Bible Promises and Encouraging Inspiration for Women</b><br><br> Barbour&#x2019;s Bible Promise Books are perennial bestsellers, with millions of copies in print.

The book is destined to become a classic. It will be read, and reread, and quoted from through the years. Personally, I am enormously enriched by it.</p><h2>Pawns In The Game</h2><p><p>Here is a true story of international intrigue, romances, corruption, graft, and political assassinations, the like of which has never been written before. It is the story of how different groups or atheistic- materialistic men have played in an international chess tournament to decide which group would win ultimate control of the wealth, natural resources, and man- power of the entire world. It is explained how the game has reached the final stage. The International Communists, and the International Capitalists, (both of whom have totalitarian ambitions) have temporarily joined hands to defeat Christian-democracy. The solution is to end the game the International Conspirators have been playing right now before one or another totalitarian-minded group imposes their ideas on the rest of mankind. The story is sensational and shocking, but it is educational because it is the TRUTH. The author offers practical solutions to problems so many people consider insoluble.</p></p><p>William Guy Carr, R.D. Commander R.C.N. (R) Retired was born June 2, 1895 and died October 2, 1959. <p>At the early age of twelve the author was thoroughly indoctrinated into the Bolshevik ideology by two revolutionary missionaries who travelled on the same ship with him out to the Orient in 1907. Unlike many others he didn't swallow the bait they offered him "Hook, Line, and Sinker." He decided to keep an open mind, and to investigate matters thoroughly, before reaching any conclusions. His investigations and studies of all angles of the International Conspiracy have taken him to nearly every country in the world. </p> <p>Commander Carr had a distinguished naval career. During World War I he served as Navigating Officer of H.M. Submarines. In World War II he was Naval Control Officer for the St. Lawrence; then Staff Officer Operations at Shelbourne, N.S.; then Senior Naval Officer at Goose Bay, Labrador.

Eager to reach his destination and unable to secure any other form of transport, he had to resort to singlehanded seamanship.<br><br>After an ignominious scene in the harbor, where a tangled anchor led him to take an early dip, he spent ten days learning the rudiments of navigation and sailing from a book, before embarking on the 9,000 mile journey aboard the 20-foot Pagan. Ahead lay a mission that was to reveal in him elements not only of astounding courage and determination, but also of incredible foolhardiness. Within 500 miles of Panama John Caldwell had already been shipwrecked once and had his boat's engine and cockpit destroyed by an angry shark. Indefatigable, he decided to press on towards his goal.He endured the terrors and discomforts of life on the high seas and enjoyed the triumphs of fighting and winning against the elements. <br><br>This is more than an exciting tale of sea-adventure. It is as compelling and unpredictable as a thriller. It is the story, witty and moving, of a man, motivated initially by love, and ultimately by his own fierce determination to survive.</p><p>John Caldwell went on to graduate from the University of California Santa Barbara. He sailed all over the world with his wife Mary and their two sons. While sailing in the Caribbean he caught a glimpse of his dream island, Prune Island. He obtained a 99-year lease on the island, planted palms, renamed it Palm Island and established his own resort. The rest of his life was spent sailing around the islands he loved and sharing his passion with lucky visitors to his Caribbean paradise.Ah yes, the romance of the sea. It seems to hit everyone at some point, even the most hardened landlubber. But John Caldwell's case is a little different. In May of 1946, the end of World War II, this American was trying desperately to return to his Australian bride Mary. Berths were limited at the end of the war, and the earliest sailing date he could manage was 1947...not soon enough. So he bought a 27' cutter in Panama: <p>"I longed to see my bride again. However, I must admit, as sailing time neared I was gripped more and more with a fever for what was ahead. The adventure of it drew me on like a magnet. In three years of sailing on heavy freighters and oilers in the Merchant Marine, I had never been so taken with the romance of a sea voyage. Suddenly I was rapt in the prospect; my own boat to command at my own will on the southern seas." </p><p>Surprisingly enough for a Merchant Marine, Caldwell had no firsthand knowledge of sailing - he did have a copy of How to Sail which he read everyday and "mentally practiced the ritual of getting under sail." He name his ship the Pagan, and with twin kittens as crew, he set off: </p><p>"I decided on the spur of the moment not to use the sails since the engine performed so agreeably. I lashed the tiller, and sprang to the bow to ready the anchor in case I needed it. It was tangled with its chain, which was strewn across the fore scuttle. </p><p>"I took up the anchor, heaved back on the folds of chain to clear them, and made to lay the anchor beside its hawsehole. The deck tilted ever so slightly I stubbed against the traveller. My foot slipped. I went over, back first, clawing upward. I was under in a second, dragged by the anchor. I dropped it, and groped to the surface. When I could see again, Pagan was a length away, sliding eagerly on toward the moored yachts. The anchor chain was rattling through the hawse..." </p><p>In a flash the ship turns on its anchor chain and heads straight for him... </p><p>Not at all what he had anticipated when he decided to sail 8,500 miles across the Pacific. The Pagan is later broadsided by a giant tree limb near an uninhabited island, and repaired. Then she is attacked by gales, and the kittens fall overboard (soon rescued) - followed by idyllic days at sea with plenty of flying fish, dolphins and other "animal companions." By August he reaches the Caroline Islands, and a hurricane: </p><p>"I lay on my back on the blown decks working with only my hands and forearms in the wind. I took my time; thought carefully over each job before I did it. When I finished, Pagan was bolstered by full shrouds and I was eased of mind. The decks, aheave and awash, didn't seem so bad with the mast safely held. </p><p>"The job completed, I made the gross error of sitting up to check it. An explosive wind bent me to a helpless angle. A flurry of bubbling water lifted me bodily and bounced me against the deckhouse and into the shrouds, then whelmed me over the rail on to a churning sea..." </p><p>And after that, he runs out of food. </p><p>Caldwell himself is immensely appealing and this gives his story added attraction. Seasoned sailors will be astounded by his early na�ve assumptions, yet his courage and persistence will earn their admiration. And the rest of us will be equally horrified and captivated.</p></p><h2>Minds Make Societies: How Cognition Explains the World Humans Create</h2><p><b>A watershed book that masterfully integrates insights from evolutionary biology, genetics, psychology, economics, and more to explore the development and workings of human societies</b><br><br> &#x201c;There is no good reason why human societies should not be described and explained with the same precision and success as the rest of nature.&#x201d; Thus argues evolutionary psychologist Pascal Boyer in this uniquely innovative book.<br><br> Integrating recent insights from evolutionary biology, genetics, psychology, economics, and other fields, Boyer offers precise models of why humans engage in social behaviors such as forming families, tribes, and nations, or creating gender roles. In fascinating, thought-provoking passages, he explores questions such as, Why is there conflict between groups? Why do people believe low-value information such as rumors? Why are there religions?

It soon becomes clear that some inmates are more equal than others; Earl Copen is one of them, an old-timer who has learned not just to survive but to thrive behind bars.

The authors of <b>Emotionally Intelligent Parenting</b> call for a new Golden Rule: Do unto your children as you would have other people do unto your children. And most important, they show us how to live by it. Based upon extensive research, firsthand experience, and case studies, Emotionally Intelligent Parenting breaks the mold of traditional parenting books by taking into account the strong role of emotions -- those of parents and children -- in psychological development. With this book, parents will learn how to communicate with children on a deeper, more gratifying level and how to help them successfully navigate the intricacies of relating to others. The authors take the five basic principles of Daniel Goleman's best-seller, <b>Emotional Intelligence</b>, and explain how they can be applied to successful parenting. To this end, the book offers suggestions, stories, dialogues, activities, and a special section of Sound EQ Parenting Bites to help parents use their emotions in the most constructive ways, focusing on such everyday issues as sibling rivalry, fights with friends, school situations, homework, and peer pressure. In the authors' extensive experience, children respond quickly to these strategies, their self-confidence is strengthened, their curiosity is piqued, and they learn to assert their independence while developing their ability to make responsible choices.</p><p>If you think it's a difficult time to be a parent, consider how challenging it is to be a child in today's world. Recent studies show that children are more impulsive, disobedient, lonely, sad, irritable, and violent than ever before. The authors of <i>Emotionally Intelligent Parenting: How to Raise a Self-Disciplined, Responsible, Socially Skilled Child</i> assert that what's needed now is an approach called emotionally intelligent parenting. An emotionally intelligent parent, according to the authors, follows the Twenty-Four Karat Golden Rule: "Do unto your children as you would have other people do unto your children." Maurice J. Elias, Steven E. Tobias, and Brian S. Friedlander pick up where Daniel Goleman's bestselling <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> leaves off, translating Goleman's basic principals into specific parenting tactics for solving daily family issues. The book includes exercises for raising the family "humor quotient," becoming aware of feelings, praising and prioritizing, and coaching your child in responsible action. <i>Emotionally Intelligent Parenting</i> is easy to follow, and provides suggestions for parents at all levels of commitment to the concept. Parents may choose to try some or all of the exercises, or may simply find it an interesting and informative read. The "Sound 'EQ' Parenting Bites to Help with Common Family Issues" closing the book are especially sensible, profoundly compassionate, and effective. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>Maurice J.

For too long, Euro-American discourse styles, emphasizing elite male privilege and conceptual linearity, have drowned out democratic and woman-centered Native approaches. Even when myopic western linearity is understood to be at work, analysis of Native American history, society, and culture has still been consistently placed in male custody. The recovery of women&#x2019;s traditions is the overarching theme in this collection of essays that helps reframe Native issues as properly gendered. &nbsp;Paula Gunn Allen looks at Indian lifeways through the many stitches of Indian clothes and the many steps of their powwow fancy dances. Lee Maracle calls for reconstitution of traditional social structures, based on Native American ways of knowing. Kay Givens McGowan identifies the exact sites where female power was weakened through the imposition of European culture, so that we might more effectively strengthen precisely those sites. Finally, Barbara Alice Mann examines how communication between Natives who have federal recognition and those who do not, as well as between Natives east and west of the Mississippi, became dysfunctional, and outlines how to reestablish good relations for the benefit of all.</p><p>Barbara Alice Mann is a lecturer in the English department at the University of Toledo and the author of <i>George Washington&#x2019;s War on Native America</i>. &nbsp;Winona LaDuke is a Native American activist and the author of <i>Recovering the Sacred: The Power of Naming and Claiming.</i>&#x201c;[<i>Make a Beautiful Way</i>] goes beyond women's studies alone, maintaining that elements unnatural to Native ways of knowing have been imposed on the study of Native America's elements consisting of European prejudice and male privilege. This focus on women&#x2019;s traditions provides essays which examine Indian lifestyles and history through women&#x2019;s lives and eyes. A fine approach which adds different perspective to Native history and issues.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Bookwatch</i> (<i>The Bookwatch</i>)</p><h2>An Encyclopaedia of Occultism (Dover Occult)</h2><p>The most famous compendium of information on the occult and the first comprehensive work of its kind, this volume originally appeared in 1920.

He'd just returned from a meeting with his boss, and had found out that he wouldn't be getting the promotion he'd been hoping for. As he thought about his situation, Jack realized that he hadn't been performing very well lately He had missed deadlines on several crucial projects. And his once perceptive mind was producing trite solutions to important problems.</p><p>He tried to put some pizzazz back into his thinking, but nothing worked. Finally, he went to an idea doctor for help. "I just don't seem to have it anymore," Jack explained.</p><p>"All right, I'll ask you a few questions so I can figure out what your problem is," the idea doctor responded. "First, have you stuck your neck out and taken any risks lately?"</p><p>"Not that I can remember," Jack answered.</p><p>"Have you been asking what if? to stretch your imagination?"</p><p>"I've been too busy."</p><p>"Have you kept an open mind when evaluating new ideas?"</p><p>"I know what works and what doesn't."</p><p>The questioning went on like this for a while. Finally Jack asked, "What's the diagnosis?"</p><p>"No doubt about it, you're stuck in a rut," the idea doctor proclaimed. "At first I thought it was just a case of plaque-on the-brain. Then all I'd have to do is prescribe some mental floss. But your situation is more serious."</p><p>"That bad, huh?" Jack shrugged.</p><p>"Yes. You've got your ends reversed."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You see, the human body has two ends on it--one to create with and one to sit on. As long as you actively pursue new,ideas, your creative end stays in good shape. But if you sit around doing the same old things, your brain descends into your rear. The result is that your ends get reversed."</p><p>Jack knew that the idea doctor was right. "What causes this?" Jack wanted to know.</p><p>The idea doctor replied, "To avoid trying new things, some people develop attitudes about creative thinking that keep them safely stuck where they are. These attitudes are:</p>It's not important.I don't have time.I already have the answer.I'm not creative.<p>"They're dangerous because they can cause you to miss some important things. For example, if you're indifferent to creative thinking, then you've failed to see that generating and implementing new ideas are crucial survival skills in a rapidly changing world.</p><p>"If you spend your time like a fireman--fighting fires, tending routines, and letting your business manage you rather than the other way around--then you haven't realized that your job might be easier if you engaged in some creative fire prevention.</p><p>"If you arrogantly believe that you've already got the right answer, strategy, or approach, you won't find out that there may be a better way to do what you're doing-perhaps until it's too late.</p><p>"And if your self-esteem is low, you haven't realized that whether or not you become the next Picasso, Einstein, or Curie, you were born with the ability to probe the world in unique ways, and your challenge is to realize this potential."</p><p>Jack listened to this explanation and then he said, "What you've told me makes a lot of sense. I think all these attitudes have influenced my thinking at one time or another during the past year." He then paused for a moment and asked, "Is there any hope? Is there any way to wake up my creative powers?"</p><p>"Yes," said the idea doctor.

He leads a devoted and growing megachurch, has several best-selling books, and a memorable slogan, "We have got to do better." Jack knows how to preach, and he understands how to chastise people into performing. What he doesn't know is anything about grace.<br> This year, when it comes time for the Christmas sermon, the congregation at Grace Cathedral will look to the pulpit, and Jack will not be there. Of course, they will have seen plenty of him already--on the news.<br> After an evening of debauchery that leads to an affair with his beautiful assistant, Jack Chisholm finds himself deserted with chilling swiftness. The church elders remove him from his own pulpit. His publisher withholds the royalties from his books. Worst of all, his wife disappears with their eight-year-old daughter.<br> But just as Jack is hitting bottom, hopeless and penniless, drinking his way to oblivion, who should appear but his long-estranged father, imploring his prodigal son: "Come home."<br> A true companion piece to Brennan Manning's&nbsp;<i>The Ragamuffin Gospel, <i>The Prodigal</i><i> </i>illustrates the power of grace through the story of a broken man who finally saw Jesus not because he preached his greatest sermon or wrote his most powerful book, but because he failed miserably. Jack Chisholm lost everything--his church, his family, his respect, and his old way of believing--but he found grace. It's the same grace that Brennan Manning devoted his life to sharing: profound in nature and coming from a God who loves us just as we are, and not as we should be<em>.</em></i><em><em><br> "A wonderfully written story that is as entertaining as it is thought provoking."<i> --Publishers Weekly</i><i>, starred review</i><br> ". . . the consummate final tale. What they have created is the Ragamuffin at his best, full of hope, full of love, and finally, full of belief in the goodness of God." --Phyllis Tickle, founding editor, Religion Department, <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> "Brennan Manning's last work continues the powerful message of grace and forgiveness that has transformed so many lives.<i> The Prodigal </i>will transform you too." --Mark Batterson, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Circle Maker</i><em> </em> </em></em></p><p>Brennan Manning spent his life and ministry helping others experience the unconditional love of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;A recovering alcoholic and former Franciscan priest, his own spiritual journey took him down a variety of paths, all of them leading to the profound reality of God's irresistible grace. His ministry responsibilities varied greatly - from teacher, to minister to the poor, to solidary reflective. As a writer, Brennan Manning is best known as the author of the contemporary classics, <i>The <i>Ragamuffin Gospel, Abba's Child, Ruthless Trust, The Importance of Being Foolish, Patched Together, and <em>The Furious Longing of God. </em><br><em></em></i></i><em><br>Greg Garrett is the critically-acclaimed author of over twenty books of fiction, nonfiction, memoir, and translation. His novel <i>Free Bird </i>was chosen by <i>Publishers Weekly </i>and the<i> Rocky Mountain News</i><i> </i>as one of the best first novels of 2002. He is also acclaimed as a writer on religion, culture, politics and religion. The 2013 Centennial Professor at Baylor University, his most recent book is<i> Entertaining Judgment: The Afterlife in Popular Imagination.</i></em>Starred Review. Cowritten by the late Manning (The Ragamuffin Gospel) and Garrett (Free Bird), this novel is more than an updated version of a well-known Bible story. The authors take the essence of the prodigal son saga and put it in the context of a fresh fictional tale that is both relevant and realistic. The story&#39;s characters are human and given to failures, but also filled with compassion and a deep desire to do the right thing. Jack Chandler has been doing the right thing for a long time, but for all the wrong reasons. As senior pastor and founder of a Seattle megachurch, Jack&#39;s good deeds are headline-making news. When he flounders, his mistakes are equally visible. As he lands at the bottom of a bottle, the last person Jack expects to come to his rescue is his long-estranged father. Jack&#39;s road to recovery and restoration is not an easy, forgive-and-forget path, but a rollercoaster ride through others&#39; misconceptions and trepidations. Many readers will relate to Jack&#39;s struggle to reconcile relationships and redeem himself. A wonderfully written story that is as entertaining as it is thought provoking.

I make this pizza recipe for two, but you can also slice it into 6 pieces to serve with wine for a snack before dinner.</p> <p>It couldn&#x2019;t be easier. First, buy a ball of dough from your local pizza shop and tell them you want one for a small-size pizza. Take it home, cover it, and leave it on the counter until ready to use. Once you see how quick and easy this pizza is to make, you&#x2019;ll want to make it again and again with whatever toppings you are in the mood for. I often make this with anchovies and oil-cured black olives, and after it comes out of the oven, I grate sharp Parmigiano-Reggiano all over the top.</p> <p>In fact, pulling this together goes so quickly that you can remove the pizza to a cutting board, leave the oven on, fit in another disk of pizza dough, arrange toppings, cook it for 3 minutes on top of the stove, and pop it in the oven for another round that will be ready in 14 minutes.</p> <p>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT BOX GRATER; 5-QUART (5-L) OR LARGER FRENCH OVEN</p> <p>8 ounces (225 g) fresh mozzarella</p> <p>3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra virgin olive oil</p> <p>1&#x2044;4 small onion, sliced very thinly</p> <p>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</p> <p>1&#x2044; 2 teaspoon salt</p> <p>1 ball pizza dough for a small pizza purchased from your local pizza shop</p> <p>4 tablespoons (60 ml) canned or bottled pizza sauce</p> <p>1 heaping tablespoon herbes de Provence</p> <p>8 fresh basil leaves, torn</p> <p>3 ounces (90 g) prosciutto</p> <p>3 ounces (90 g) Parmesan cheese</p> <p>PREP</p> <p>Preheat oven to 425� F (220� C). Grate half the mozzarella on the large holes of a box grater. Slice the rest into big pieces.</p> <p>COOK</p> <p>Heat the oil in the French oven over medium heat, toss in the onion, garlic, and salt, and cook until the onion slices are tender, about 6 minutes.</p> <p>With a slotted spoon, scoop out the onion mixture to a plate and reserve, leaving the oil at the bottom. The onions and garlic will have flavored the oil and will flavor the underside of the pizza.</p> <p>When the French oven is cooler and can be touched, place the pizza dough into the bottom over the oil, and stretch it out to fit, bringing up a slight rim around the sides.</p> <p>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough and spoon on the cooked onions and garlic. Sprinkle with the herbes de Provence and basil, arrange slices of mozzarella and prosciutto all over, distribute the grated mozzarella, and then grate the Parmesan to finish.</p> <p>Place the French oven on the stovetop, cover with its lid, and cook over medium high heat for 3 minutes.</p> <p>Remove the lid, place in the oven, and bake for 14 minutes, until crisp and golden.</p> <p>Remove the pizza from the oven. With a fork, gently coax up the edges then, with a spatula, lift the whole pizza to a cutting board. Slice and serve.</p> <p>IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS</p> <p>Fry pepperoni slices in the oil, remove to a plate, and fit the pizza dough over the pepperoni-flavored oil in the French oven for an incredibly delicious crust. Use the pepperoni slices for the top of the pie. </p></p><h2>Rick and Morty Vol. 9 (9)</h2><p>The hit comic book series based on Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland&#x2019;s hilarious [adult swim]&#x2122; animated show RICK AND MORTY&#x2122; continues in all-new stories not seen on TV!<br><br>This volume collects never before seen adventures of degenerate genius scientist Rick Sanchez and his timid grandson Morty Smith, like the very FIRST time they met The Vindicators, and a very special look at the fan-favorite Cronenberg universe.

Ever since Godzilla (or, Gojira, as he is known in Japan) crawled out of his radioactive birthplace to cut a swath of destruction through Tokyo, he has claimed a place alongside King Kong and others in the movie monster pantheon. He is the third most recognizable Japanese celebrity in the United States, and his fan base continues to grow as children today prove his enduring appeal. Now, Bill Tsutsui, a life-long fan and historian, takes a light-hearted look at the big, green, radioactive lizard, revealing how he was born and how he became a megastar. With humorous anecdotes, <i>Godzilla on My Mind</i> explores his lasting cultural impact on the world.

Hotez's nineteen-month-old daughter, Rachel, was diagnosed with autism. Dr. Hotez, a pediatrician-scientist who develops vaccines for neglected tropical diseases affecting the world's poorest people, became troubled by the decades-long rise of the influential anti-vaccine community and their inescapable narrative around childhood vaccines and autism. The alleged link between the two was first espoused in a fraudulent scientific paper, long since retracted, but the story shows no signs of letting up. As a result, we've seen deadly and disabling outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases around the country, and Texas, where Hotez lives, is at particular risk.</p><p>In <i>Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism</i>, Hotez draws on his experiences as a pediatrician, vaccine scientist, and father of an autistic child. Outlining the arguments on both sides of the debate, he examines the science that refutes the concerns of the anti-vaccine movement, debunks current conspiracy theories alleging a cover-up by the CDC, and critiques the scientific community's failure to effectively communicate the facts about vaccines and autism to the general public, all while sharing his very personal story of raising a now-adult daughter with autism.</p><p>A uniquely authoritative account, this important book<i> </i>persuasively provides evidence for the genetic basis of autism and illustrates how the neurodevelopmental pathways of autism are under way before birth. Dr. Hotez reminds readers of the many victories of vaccines over disease while warning about the growing dangers of the anti-vaccine movement, especially in the United States and Europe. A former US Science Envoy for the Department of State, he also explains what's at stake if the movement continues to gain ground. Opening with a foreword by leading medical ethicist Arthur L. Caplan, this book is a must-read for parent groups, child advocates, teachers, health-care providers, government policymakers, health and science policy experts, and anyone caring for a family member or friend with autism.</p><p>"When Peter Hotez&#x2015;an erudite, highly trained scientist who is a true hero for his work in saving the world's poor and downtrodden&#x2015;shares his knowledge and clinical insights along with his parental experience, when his beliefs in the value of what he does are put to the test of a life guiding his own child's challenges, then you must pay attention. You should. This book brings to an end the link between autism and vaccination."&#x2015;from the foreword by Arthur L.

In this refreshingly sensible book, O'Connor focuses on an additional factor often overlooked: our own habits. Unwittingly we get good at depression. We learn how to hide it, how to work around it. We may even achieve great things, but with constant struggle rather than satisfaction. Relying on these methods to make it through each day, we deprive ourselves of true recovery, of deep joy and healthy emotion.<br><br>UNDOING DEPRESSION teaches us how to replace depressive patterns with a new and more effective set of skills. We already know how to "do" depression-and we can learn how to undo it. With a truly holistic approach that synthesizes the best of the many schools of thought about this painful disease, O'Connor offers new hope-and new life-for sufferers of depression.</p><p>Richard O'Connor is the author of four books, <i>Undoing Depression,</i> <em>Active Treatment of Depression, Undoing Perpetual Stress</em>, and <em>Happy At Last</em>. For fourteen years he was executive director of the Northwest Center for Family Service and Mental Health, overseeing the treatment of almost a thousand patients per year. He is a practicing psychotherapist, with offices in Canaan, Connecticut, and New York City, and he lives with his family in Lakeville, Connecticut."An uncommonly thorough and useful guide."-<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"<em>Undoing Depression</em> is distinguished by its common sense, its humanity, and its absence of dogmatism.

But tragically, millions are seeking spiritual fulfillment in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways. </p><p>Author Larry Huggins knows this heartfelt emotion from firsthand experience. Before he met Jesus Christ as his Savior, he was committed to experimenting with a smorgasbord of spiritual beliefs that eventually brought him into the clutches of demonic powers&#x2014;and almost cost him his life. </p><p>But when Huggins met Jesus, he discovered another power, a greater power&#x2014;the power of the Blood of the Lamb. Huggins points out that other spiritual forces cry out for our attention and allegiance&#x2014;false religions, positive thinking that does not acknowledge our need for God, New Age philosophies and practices, and Satanic rituals. But only the Blood of Jesus speaks to us with authentic words that bring healing and health, forgiveness of sins, victorious Christian living, prosperity and true success. </p><p>In addition to individual use, this title is ideal for small group Bible studies and other Christian education activities.</p></p><p>Rev.

Then, it was expanded and updated in a soft cover third edition and published in 1986. Since that time, only minor changes have been made.<br><br>During the late 1980s and on through the 1990s, new scientific observations and medical reports provided support for the yeast connection to PMS, psoriasis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, vulvodynia (burning vulva), interstitial cystitis and autism. There was also new information about:<br><br>&#x25aa; The role of simple sugars in promoting yeast overgrowth in the digestive tract.<br>&#x25aa; Prescription antiyeast medications, including Diflucan and Sporanox.<br>&#x25aa; Nonprescription antiyeast agents, including probiotics, garlic and citrus seed extracts.<br><br>There was also an &#x201c;explosion&#x201d; of knowledge about:<br><br>&#x25aa; Supplemental vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids.<br>&#x25aa; Free radicals and their role in contributing to chronic health disorders and the importance of antioxidants in controlling them.<br>&#x25aa; Ginkgo biloba and CoQ10 and other nonprescription remedies that contribute to better health.<br>&#x25aa; The importance of vegetables and fruits and their role in preventing cancer and other chronic health disorders.<br>&#x25aa; The mind/body connection.<br>&#x25aa; Food and chemical sensitivities.<br>&#x25aa; Thyroid and adrenal hormones.<br><br>I gathered all this new material together and included it in my 731-page book, <em>The Yeast Connection and the Woman</em>, published in the late spring of 1995.

DuBois writes that the question whites want to ask him is: &#x201c;How does it feel to be a problem?&#x201d; In <em>The Heart of Whiteness</em>, Robert Jensen writes that it is time for white people in America to self-consciously reverse the direction of that question and to fully acknowledge that in the racial arena, they are the problem.</p><p>While some whites would like to think that we have reached &#x201c;the end of racism&#x201d; in the United States, and others would like to celebrate diversity but are oblivious to the political, economic and social consequences of a nation&#x2014;and their sense of self&#x2014;founded on a system of white supremacy, Jensen proposes a different approach.

Mixing personal experience with data and theory, he faces down the difficult realities of racism and white privilege. He argues that any system that denies non-whites their full humanity also keeps whites from fully accessing their own.</p><p>This book is both a cautionary tale for those who believe that they have transcended racism, and also an expression of the hope for genuine transcendence. When white people fully understand and accept the painful reality that they are indeed &#x201c;the problem,&#x201d; it should lead toward serious attempts to change one&#x2019;s own life and join with others to change society.</p><p><strong>Robert Jensen </strong>is the author of <em>Citizens of the Empire</em>.

During every major period in the country's history, bees and beekeepers have represented order and stability in a country without a national religion, political party, or language. Bees in America is an enlightening cultural history of bees and beekeeping in the United States. Tammy Horn, herself a beekeeper, offers a varied social and technological history from the colonial period, when the British first introduced bees to the New World, to the present, when bees are being used by the American military to detect bombs. Early European colonists introduced bees to the New World as part of an agrarian philosophy borrowed from the Greeks and Romans. Their legacy was intended to provide sustenance and a livelihood for immigrants in search of new opportunities, and the honey bee became a sign of colonization, alerting Native Americans to settlers' westward advance. Colonists imagined their own endeavors in terms of bees' hallmark traits of industry and thrift and the image of the busy and growing hive soon shaped American ideals about work, family, community, and leisure. The image of the hive continued to be popular in the eighteenth century, symbolizing a society working together for the common good and reflecting Enlightenment principles of order and balance. Less than a half-century later, Mormons settling Utah (where the bee is the state symbol) adopted the hive as a metaphor for their protected and close-knit culture that revolved around industry, harmony, frugality, and cooperation. In the Great Depression, beehives provided food and bartering goods for many farm families, and during World War II, the War Food Administration urged beekeepers to conserve every ounce of beeswax their bees provided, as more than a million pounds a year were being used in the manufacture of war products ranging from waterproofing products to tape. The bee remains a bellwether in modern America. Like so many other insects and animals, the bee population was decimated by the growing use of chemical pesticides in the 1970s. Nevertheless, beekeeping has experienced a revival as natural products containing honey and beeswax have increased the visibility and desirability of the honey bee. Still a powerful representation of success, the industrious honey bee continues to serve both as a source of income and a metaphor for globalization as America emerges as a leader in the Information Age.</p><p><b>Tammy Horn </b>was raised with beekeepers on both sides of her family. She is the director of Coal Country Beeworks, a multi-service project in which surface mine sites are reclaimed with pollinator habitat in eastern Kentucky."Provides a thorough social history of America, examining all possible instances of honey bee imagery used in cultural contexts.

E. Lawrence&#x2014;the legendary British soldier, strategist, scholar, and adventurer whose exploits as &#x201c;Lawrence of Arabia&#x201d; created a legacy of mythic proportions in his own lifetime. Many know T.E. Lawrence from David Lean&#x2019;s Oscar-winning 1962 biopic&#x2014;based, itself, upon Lawrence&#x2019;s autobiographical <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>&#x2014;but in the tradition of modern biographers like John Meacham, David McCullough, and Barbara Leaming, Michael Korda&#x2019;s penetrating new examination reveals new depth and character in the twentieth century&#x2019;s quintessential English hero. <br></p><p><p>The story of an epic life on a grand scale, Michael Korda&#x2019;s Hero is a gripping, in-depth biography of the extraordinary, mysterious, and dynamic Englishman still famous the world over as &#x201c;Lawrence of Arabia.&#x201d; An Oxford scholar and archaeologist sent to Cairo as a young intelligence officer in 1916, Lawrence was a born leader, utterly fearless and seemingly impervious to pain and fatigue. A bold and ruthless warrior, he was the virtual inventor of modern insurgency and guerrilla warfare; a writer of genius who alternately sought and fled the limelight. Korda digs deeper than anyone before him to expose the flesh-and-blood man and his contradictory nature&#x2014;farsighted visionary; diplomat and kingmaker; shy, sensitive, and private man; genius military strategist; arguably the first modern &#x201c;media celebrity&#x201d; . . . and one of its first victims. <em>Hero</em> is the magisterial story of one of the most unique and fascinating figures of modern times&#x2014;the arch-hero whose life was, at once, a triumph and a sacrifice.</p><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S. Grant</em>, <em>Ike</em>, <em>Hero</em>, and <em>Charmed Lives</em>. Educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served in the Royal Air Force. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and on its fiftieth anniversary was awarded the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Hungary. He and his wife, Margaret, make their home in Dutchess County, New York.</p></p><h2>Meet Me in Scotland (Kilts and Quilts)</h2><p><b>You can run from your problems, but you can&#x2019;t hide from love in the Scottish seaside town of Gandiegow....</b><br>&nbsp;<br>When a video of her calling <i>happily ever after</i> &#x201c;a foolish fantasy&#x201d; goes viral, marriage therapist Emma Castle is out of a job&#x2014;and off to Scotland.

Exactly as her boss back in Los Angeles&#x2014;now her ex-boss&#x2014;had feared. She still couldn&#x2019;t believe it. <i>Fired.</i> Egghead Emma had been fired.</p><p>The video wasn&#x2019;t a sex tape, which her parents certainly would&#x2019;ve preferred over the reality of what was hitting the Internet. She watched the forty-eight-second clip for a third time. How superior her British accent sounded, how smug she looked, like she had all the answers. Those forty-eight seconds had irrevocably changed her future. <i>Thirty years old and already a washout.</i> Oh, bloody hell, what would she do now?</p><p>Well, that&#x2019;s why she was here sitting on the tarmac&#x2014;hoping to figure things out with her best friend, Claire.</p><p>As the other passengers pulled down their bags and left the plane, she stared out the window to what looked like midnight in the dead of winter. It was early evening, but a huge blizzard was brewing. An accurate metaphor for her life. She slid her phone back into her pocket.</p><p><i>Certainly I&#x2019;m not the only marriage therapist in the world who doesn&#x2019;t believe in happily-ever-afters.</i></p><p>But she <i>was</i> the only one to get caught on hidden camera telling a couple how it really was. As a Brit working in America, she&#x2019;d learned a thing or two about this time of year. At the clinic, they&#x2019;d called them the Thanksgiving crowd. A week before the turkey and the dressing, marriages were either exploding or imploding because of the approaching holidays. Emma had apparently cracked up right along with them, telling one of her couples how it all was going to play out. Unfortunately, she&#x2019;d been caught on tape. <i>Don&#x2019;t waste your money. Marriage therapy serves one purpose and one purpose only: getting you through the inevitable divorce.</i> In her defense, she&#x2019;d only been telling her clients the truth. It was what she&#x2019;d seen day in and day out.</p><p>She closed her eyes and laid her head back on the rest, trying to put the video out of her mind and trying not to imagine what her parents would say when they found out. Mum, the World&#x2019;s Leading Sex Therapist,<i> </i>and Dad, Hollywood&#x2019;s Marriage Counselor,<i> </i>would insist on having her professionally evaluated when the news reached them. But maybe then they would finally accept the truth. Emma wasn&#x2019;t cut out to be a couples counselor, and her controlling parents couldn&#x2019;t guilt her into doing it any longer. They&#x2019;d have to find someone else to collaborate on their books and TV promotions. At times like these, Emma wished she had a sibling. Someone else to fulfill her parents&#x2019; expectations. But having a sibling would require her parents to at least be in the same country at the same time, not to mention the same bed.</p><p>When the aisle cleared, she hurried off the plane and searched the waiting crowd. God, she&#x2019;d missed her best friend. She&#x2019;d hesitated only a moment when Claire had invited her to come to Gandiegow. Running away couldn&#x2019;t fix the predicament she&#x2019;d gotten herself into, but it would give her a respite, and oh, how she needed a best-friend booster shot to help make things better. Then she could head to London to face Mum. Hopefully, by then, she&#x2019;d have a few things worked out, maybe even a plan for what to do next.</p><p>Emma&#x2019;s mobile rang; it was Claire.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; Emma scanned the faces around her. &#x201c;Are you waiting at baggage reclaim?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nay.&#x201d; Claire paused. &#x201c;I sent Gabriel to pick you up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Emma cried. The people around her turned and stared. At the same time, her mother&#x2019;s voice rang in her ear: <i>Losing one&#x2019;s temper is not in a proper Englishwoman&#x2019;s repertoire.</i></p><p>Hissing wasn&#x2019;t, either, but Emma did it anyway into the phone. &#x201c;For your sake, Claire, I hope you&#x2019;re speaking of Gabriel the archangel and not the other one.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire gave her attitude right back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t grumble at me. It&#x2019;s not my fault your flight was delayed. You know how early I have to get up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t your husband take the morning shift for you?&#x201d;</p><p>Claire tsked<i>.</i> &#x201c;The scones are <i>my</i> specialty. The restaurant depends upon them.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma sighed heavily. &#x201c;Yes, I know. But still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gabriel was a saint to offer,&#x201d; Claire defended.</p><p><i>Yeah, right,</i> Emma thought.</p><p>Her friend went on. &#x201c;Is he there yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Gabriel would be the perfect end to her perfectly horrible day.</p><p>&#x201c;Buck up, Emma. You&#x2019;re a grown woman. You can handle a few hours with him.&#x201d; With that Claire said goodbye and hung up.</p><p>Emma&#x2019;s temples began to throb. Claire was testing her patience as only Claire could do. Gabriel MacGregor was incorrigible, plain and simple. Claire <i>knew</i> she couldn&#x2019;t stand being around him.</p><p>When Claire and Dominic had first coupled up, Emma had spent a fair amount of time in Gabriel&#x2019;s presence. Dominic and Gabriel were inseparable, closer than most brothers she knew. Not biological brothers, but Gabriel&#x2019;s father had taken Dominic in when he was orphaned.</p><p>Emma had visited Claire often back then and had been thrust into Gabriel&#x2019;s path over and over. He&#x2019;d made a lasting impression, but not in a good way. He had a way of flustering her that was very uncomfortable. For years now she&#x2019;d successfully avoided him, making sure she had plenty of excuses at the ready if Gabriel was to be present. The last time she&#x2019;d actually seen him was at Claire and Dominic&#x2019;s wedding, ten years ago. He&#x2019;d shown up late, roaring in on his motorcycle, wearing a leather jacket, leather pants, and an earring. Undignified and unrefined, especially for the occasion. Even worse, he had stirred something deep inside her she couldn&#x2019;t name. Ten minutes later, decked out in a tux, he&#x2019;d smiled at her, tucked her arm into his, and walked her down the aisle, best man to her maid of honor. He&#x2019;d behaved appropriately during the ceremony, but then at the reception he&#x2019;d flirted with all the bridesmaids and had taken most of them back to his room for a pajama party. Emma sniffed. <i>Certainly no pajamas had been involved. </i>And Egghead Emma hadn&#x2019;t been invited, either. Gabriel MacGregor with his deep Scottish burr was a scoundrel&#x2014;a rake.</p><p>She sighed heavily. There would be no helping it. She&#x2019;d be forced to spend the next several hours with him in the car, but thankfully, it would only be that. Surely his visit to Gandiegow would be over soon and she wouldn&#x2019;t have to endure his presence in the small Scottish town for too long.</p><p>Emma stowed her phone and realized she was being stared at by an extraordinarily handsome man. Tall, dark, and devilish. A rake through and through. As a trained psychologist, she recognized within herself all the telltale signs of instant attraction. Her pulse raced, she involuntarily licked her lips, and she brushed her hair off her shoulders.</p><p>Then recognition hit. <i>Dr. Gabriel MacGregor.</i></p><p><i>Bugger me.</i></p><p>At twenty he&#x2019;d been handsome and she&#x2019;d thought him a man. But now she saw she was wrong. Dead wrong. He made the twenty-year-old Gabriel look young and wiry and inconsequential. This man had muscles filling out his long-sleeved polo, the breadth of an American football player, and the stance of a Scottish warrior. She did it again. Licked her lips. <i>I&#x2019;m in deep trouble.</i></p><p>He made his way through the crowd to her, not smiling, not happy to see her, either. In truth, she couldn&#x2019;t blame him. She had been a pill at Claire&#x2019;s wedding, but she had wanted everything to run smoothly for her friend&#x2019;s big day. Emma might&#x2019;ve crossed the line by scolding Gabriel at his tardiness. And she&#x2019;d definitely given him plenty of attitude during the reception about his <i>tart-iness.</i> All those women, indeed. What could one man do with so many at once? From the novels she&#x2019;d read&#x2014;for pure research, mind you&#x2014;she knew. Sex and lots of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have more luggage?&#x201d; he said in his firm baritone burr.</p><p>It ran over her like warm syrup. <i>No, butter. No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i> She fanned herself. She was incensed at her own visceral reaction. <i>And he hasn&#x2019;t given me a proper greeting</i>. At least she could be civilized.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Gabriel.&#x201d; She felt her nose lift higher in the air. It might be misconstrued as snooty, but seriously, the man was six-three if he was an inch. She cranked her head back to inspect his face.</p><p>He gave her a one-sided frown and seemed to be inspecting her, too. But not her face.</p><p>&#x201c;You filled out,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Instinctively, she put an arm over her breasts. Her cheeks burned. She started to give him a piece of her mind, but then she got angry with herself for letting him provoke her.</p><p>Defiantly, she put her arm down and stuck out her chest. &#x201c;Look all you want. They expanded all on their own. Without surgical intervention.&#x201d; Although her mother at one time had offered to pay for C cups if her nearly flat chest remained&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>flat</i>.</p><p>Emma definitely wouldn&#x2019;t lower herself and explain to Gabriel&#x2014;a doctor who should know these things&#x2014;that Egghead Emma had been a late bloomer. In almost every area, except intelligence.</p><p>&#x201c;No reason to get your panties in a twist. I only meant it as a compliment.&#x201d; He continued to feast his eyes on her.</p><p>She put her hands on her hips and glared back. &#x201c;Are you done yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For now.&#x201d; He gave her an unrepentant grin. <i>Still the rogue.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I have more luggage,&#x201d; she said, answering his earlier question.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Without permission, he reached for her carry-on.</p><p>She grabbed his arm, stopping him. In the process, her fingers landed on an anvil-hard biceps. She yanked her hand away and snipped at him, &#x201c;I have it. Thank you.&#x201d; She tugged back her bag. &#x201c;Your hands are filthy.&#x201d;</p><p>As he glanced down at the grease under his fingernails, she took the opportunity to head off to the baggage reclaim, all the while giving herself a stern lecture. Getting grease off her Louis Vuitton luggage wasn&#x2019;t the issue. He was a dog, and not the harmless type, either.</p><p><i>I can&#x2019;t be attracted to Gabriel MacGregor. Not again. I just can&#x2019;t. </i>He was way out of her league. Besides, what self-respecting woman would want to get involved with a cad like him?</p><p><i>And those hands.</i> His hands didn&#x2019;t look like doctors&#x2019; hands&#x2014;soft and delicate. He had the hands of an oil-rig mechanic.</p><p>She also noticed he didn&#x2019;t wear a wedding band.</p><p>Of course, Claire would&#x2019;ve told her if Gabriel had married, wouldn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;d told Emma when he&#x2019;d suddenly gone off to medical school. Emma hadn&#x2019;t believed it at the time, assuring herself that a do-nothing like him would certainly work in a grimy garage for the rest of his life.</p><p><i>Oh, dear.</i> Her thoughts did sound priggish, didn&#x2019;t they? But Gabriel seemed to bring out the worst in her. She&#x2019;d treated him abominably back then, and she felt herself heading down the same path now. She would never be as serene and proper as her mother would like&#x2014;all that etiquette training down the drain. Over the years, Emma had tried to be the person her mother wanted her to be, but she&#x2019;d fallen short. She&#x2019;d also fallen short of the person she wanted to be. But blast it, she was still trying to figure out who that person was.</p><p>With his long legs, Gabriel caught up to her. She automatically glanced over. He was all hard lines and pheromones.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you frowning?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having a difficult time seeing you as a physician.&#x201d; She probably should keep her sentiments to herself, but they&#x2019;d always spoken their minds to each other, the truth flowing easily between them. <i>Each of them giving the other more candor than Mum&#x2019;s society friends would approve of.</i> &#x201c;Unless, of course, you use your title primarily as a way to pick up women.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned at her. &#x201c;Princess, are we going to get off on the wrong foot again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That depends on you,&#x201d; she spouted. She did her best to sound assertive and unruffled, even though she felt unraveled and unsure. Seeing him didn&#x2019;t help. And the past thirty-six hours had her more than a little battered and bruised. She&#x2019;d been fired and displaced. If he could see inside her&#x2014;see the real Emma Castle&#x2014;he&#x2019;d know she wasn&#x2019;t such a snob. She didn&#x2019;t have all the answers. In fact, he&#x2019;d see how she was questioning every aspect of her life and every choice she&#x2019;d ever made.</p><p>She put the focus back on him to take the focus off herself. It helped her feel less uncomfortable. She raked her eyes over him unabashedly. Doctors were supposed to be old and nerdy. Doctors were supposed to instill a sense of calm and trust. Doctors were not supposed to conjure up all sorts of vivid images of a steamy nature. Yes, she could definitely imagine Dr. Gabriel MacGregor in his lab coat, <i>playing doctor</i>. Just the thought sent a warm nervous tingle zipping through her veins, throwing her limbic system into a tizzy. <i>Gads.</i></p><p>It rankled that he, a former grease monkey, had made something of himself. Her only claim to fame was that she&#x2019;d succeeded in becoming a huge failure. But she couldn&#x2019;t let him see how vulnerable she felt. No doubt he&#x2019;d take advantage of it. She had to admit that he had every right to fling back one of her past sermons into her face. <i>It&#x2019;s time to become an actual adult and contribute something to society.</i> The amount of bull she&#x2019;d dished out regularly to him in their younger days was embarrassing. Especially since, by anyone&#x2019;s standards, she was the screwup now. What had she ever done for society? Help people end their relationships?</p><p>At the baggage carousel, she intended to corral her own luggage, but she&#x2019;d packed too heavily. In the end, Gabriel stepped in and hoisted her bag off, acting as if it was nothing more than cotton balls in his surgery. &#x201c;Saint Gabriel,&#x201d; she muttered under her breath.</p><p>He raised a superior eyebrow at her. &#x201c;<i>Thank you </i>is the <i>proper</i> response. Has Ms. Manners forgotten how to comport herself?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Him and his bloody burr.</i></p><p><i>And accuracy.</i></p><p>Yes, she should&#x2019;ve taken the high road and been grateful. But he made her forget she was supposed to be a lady.</p><p>With a huff, she pulled up the handle on her bag.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in there, by the way?&#x201d; He pointed to her rolling suitcase...</p></p><h2>Parallel Universes: The Search for Other Worlds</h2><p>From renowned physicist Fred Alan Wolf comes his enthralling and accessible exploration of parallel universes and the various theories surrounding them.<br><br>In this "enthralling read" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>), travel through the frontiers of space as physicist Fred Alan Wolf guides you through the complex yet intruging concept of parallel universes. Challenge your preceptions of the universe and explore ideas as varied as superspace theater and zero-time ghosts and even explore a future where time travel is real and black holes are gateways rather than endings.</p><p>Fred Alan Wolf is an author of eleven books, a physicist, and a lecturer who earned his PhD in theoretical physics at UCLA in 1963. He has taught at San Diego State University as well as the University of London, the University of Paris, the Hahn-Meitner Institute for Nuclear Physics in Berlin, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is a member of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Collegium of Scholars, and the author of eleven books including <i>Mind into Matter</i> and <i>Taking the Quantum Leap</i>, for which he received the National Book Award.Wolf's readers should get ready for a wild intellectual ride through the convoluted realms of quantum mechanics, relativity, black holes and imaginary time. The physicist ( Starwave ) is a strong proponent of the "many-worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics, and he launches a ferocious assault on conservative scientists who espouse the "Copenhagen" interpretation. Essentially, the debate hinges on the role of consciousness in measuring quantum events: Copenhagenists argue that a quantum measurement causes the "collapse" of a particle's probability wave, while Wolf claims the act of measuring actually causes the universe to split in two. The equations of relativity and quantum physics support both interpretations. Wolf describes what it would be like to travel through a black hole to a parallel universe; claims that the future must communicate with the present; answers the question of whether the universe had a radius before we started to measure it; and argues that schizophrenics may be in touch with parallel universes.

Beautifully rendered and rippling with family dysfunction, secrets, deaths, drunks, and old resentments, Shonda Buchanan's memoir is an inspiring story that explores her family's legacy of being African Americans with American Indian roots and how they dealt with not just society's ostracization but the consequences of this dual inheritance. Buchanan was raised as a Black woman, who grew up hearing cherished stories of her multi-racial heritage, while simultaneously suffering from everything she (and the rest of her family) didn't know. Tracing the arduous migration of Mixed Bloods, or Free People of Color, from the Southeast to the Midwest, Buchanan tells the story of her Michigan tribe -- a comedic yet manically depressed family of fierce women, who were everything from caretakers and cornbread makers to poets and witches, and men who were either ignored, protected, imprisoned, or maimed -- and how their lives collided over love, failure, fights, and prayer despite a stacked deck of challenges, including addiction and abuse. Ultimately, Buchanan's nomadic people endured a collective identity crisis after years of constantly straddling two, then three, races. The physical, spiritual, and emotional displacement of American Indians who met and married Mixed or Black slaves and indentured servants at America's early crossroads is where this powerful journey begins.&nbsp;<i>Black Indian </i>doesn't have answers, nor does it aim to represent every American's multi-ethnic experience. Instead, it digs as far down into this one family's history as it can go sometimes, with a bit of discomfort. But every family has its own truth, and Buchanan's search for hers will resonate in anyone who has wondered "maybe there's more than what I'm being told."</p><p>A moving memoir exploring one family&#39;s legacy of African Americans with American Indian roots.Like my collection of poetry, Who's Afraid of Black Indians? published in 2012, my memoir, Black Indian, equally explores my life and experiences growing up in a small Mid-western city replete with Mixed race communities. Yet it's not just my story: it's my sister's story. It's my mom and aunts' story. This book is a recovery tale of landscape, legacy and inheritance. I've grown up with the stories of Black people with American Indian heritage who married whites; full flood Cherokees, according to records from my great-aunt, who married Mulattos. The ethnic intersections of these families created communities of color who knew their own origins but were forced into legal racial classification. When I was a child, I didn't know any of that. I just saw a mother with beautiful translucent skin and pitch black hair. Lining Mama up next to my aunts, they were women whose beauty proceeded them before they walked into any room. But this book also captures the rupture of identity,&nbsp;cycles of abuse and addiction and how we survived it. This book captures my family's beauty, our stories, our loss as well as our struggle to maintain an identity and selfhood in the constant racial re-classification, theft of land and ethnic erasure of the last three hundred years.&nbsp;I would love to&nbsp;hear any feedback on my books (hopefully nice), but I would truly love a review of my book(s).

Egyptian Art</h2><p><p>A lifelong devotee of ancient Egyptian and Oriental culture, the French author, artist, and scholar Achille-Constant-Th�odore-�mile Prisse d&#x2019;Avennes (1807&#x2013;1879) is famed as one of the most influential Egyptologists, long before the discipline was even properly established.</p><p>Prisse first embarked on his explorations in 1836, documenting sites throughout the Nile Valley, often under his Egyptian pseudonym, Edris Effendi. Prisse&#x2019;s first publication of notes, drawings, and squeezes (a kind of frottage) came in the form of Les Monuments �gyptiens, a modest collection of 51 plates, but one met with considerable acclaim in popular and intellectual circles. Encouraged by his success, Prisse returned to Egypt in the late 1850s to expand his work into the collection L&#x2019;Histoire de l&#x2019;art �gyptien&#x2015;together with his first volume, these two tomes make up a truly complete survey of Egyptian art.</p><p>His albums cover architecture, drawing, sculpture, painting, and industrial or minor arts, with sections, plans, architectural details, and surface decoration all documented with utmost sensitivity and accuracy.

He shares personal stories and anecdotes from his life, provides comforting messages of hope, and discusses the ways flawed families can make you a better person.

The pressures and the powerlessness we experience in so many situations seem to shrivel our souls; the countless challenges we face stupefy us, paralyze us. The world is speeding up to build&#x2014;�in theory&#x2014;�a better society, yet paradoxically at the end of the day there is no time for anything or for anyone. We have no time to spend with our families or our communities, no time for friendship, for consensus, or for reflection.<br><br>We should ask ourselves: How can we enact the joy of the Gospel in our daily lives, in our cities? Is Christian hope possible, here and now?<br><br>These two questions shape our identity, the lives of our families, our towns, and our cities.<br><br>Homily, March 25, 2017<br><br>A salad with oil&nbsp;. . .<br><br>Jesus had just finished speaking about the dangers of wealth, and about how difficult it was for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Peter asked Him, &#x201c;We have left everything and followed You. What do we get in return?&#x201d; Jesus was generous with Peter.

Yes, you left everything behind. Yes, you will receive many things here on earth as well. But you will also be persecuted.<br><br>It&#x2019;s like salad, served with the oil of persecution.

This is the message that you are called on to share with the people around you: at school, in the workplace, in your families, in your universities and your communities.

But you need to keep the question in your heart and take it home with you, as a kind of homework. And you have to do your homework on your own. Is there joy in your home? Is there joy in your family? That&#x2019;s the question you have to answer.<br><br>Dear families, you know very well that the true joy we experience within a family is not superficial; it does not come from material things, or from the fact that everything seems to be going well&nbsp;. . . True joy comes from a profound harmony among people, something that we feel in our hearts and that lets us experience the beauty of togetherness, of mutual support along life&#x2019;s journey. This feeling of deep joy is rooted in God, the presence of God in the family, and His love, which is welcoming, merciful, and respectful toward all. Above all, this love is patient. Patience is a virtue of God and we must cultivate it in family life, and learn to have this patient love for one another. To be patient with one another. A patient love. God alone knows how to create harmony out of differences. If God&#x2019;s love is lacking, the family loses its harmony, individualism prevails, and joy fades. But the family that experiences the joy of faith communicates that joy naturally; joy is the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

Dr. Moody's insightful and wonderfully affirming narrative reveals the challenges and opportunities offered us by the spiritual stages we go through as we explore the question of meaning in our lives.</p><p>The quintessential baby-boom seeker of spiritual fulfillment, Harry Moody came of age in the late '60s, began his search for deeper meaning, gradually assimilated into professional life, married, and became "normal." The only difference is that Moody never stopped searching, and <i>The Five Stages of the Soul</i> is the culmination of his efforts. Everyone, especially in the middle years, he says, takes an interest in the spiritual life, and more or less goes through five stages of development: the call, the search, the struggle, the breakthrough, the return. In a colorful array of stories from contemporary America and legends and myths from religious traditions around the world, Moody unveils the varieties of spiritual paths and the common threads that bind them all together. As a mirror of our own search, <i>The Five Stages of the Soul</i> is as useful as it is informative.In a groundbreaking book that interweaves twenty years of case studies and research in the field of aging with an exhaustive knowledge of psychology, religion and literature, Harry R. Moody, co-founder and Director of the Brookdale Institute of Aging, reveals the spiritual passages that the vast majority of us encounter in life and explores the opportunities those spiritual stages offer us in achieving a sense of inner fulfillment.<p></p><p>At some point in our lives, most of us begin to question what life is all about, what the purpose of our existence is. This first of the passages in our spiritual lives often arises as the result of the death of a parent or other loved one, the birth of a child, or any number of life-changing events that force us to rethink who and what we are. Everyone responds differently to what Dr. Moody describes as the Call. For some, it may lead back to traditional religion; for others to good works in the community; still others turn to mysticism. Those who ignore the Call are called again, for the Call comes not once, but any number of times in one's life, and in any number of ways. For those who heed the Call, it is an opportunity to reflect on their inner lives, to explore and fulfill a deeper part of themselves. In<i>The Five Stages of the Soul</i>, Dr. Moody identifies five specific spiritual stages that make up our inner lives, exploring the psychology of our spiritual development and interweaving the wisdom of Western and Eastern spiritual masters as we struggle through the labyrinth of life.</p><p></p><p>Written in richly textured narrative that constantly inspires as it offers a detailed roadmap of our spiritual lives, <i>The Five Stages of the Soul</i> is reminiscent in its approach of the best work of Scott Peck and Thomas Moore.</p></p><h2>Women and Worship at Corinth: Paul&#39;s Rhetorical Arguments in 1 Corinthians</h2><p>Making sense of Paul&#39;s arguments in 1 Corinthians 11-14 regarding both the role of women in public worship and the value of tongues and prophecy for the unbeliever has long posed challenges for any lay reader or scholar. Despite numerous explanations offered over the years, these passages remain marked by inconsistencies, contradictions, and puzzles. Lucy Peppiatt offers a reading of 1 Corinthians 11-14 in which she proposes that Paul is in conversation with the Corinthian male leadership regarding their domineering, superior, and selfish practices, including coercing the women to wear head coverings, lording it over the &#34;have-nots&#34; at the Lord&#39;s Supper, speaking in tongues all at once, and ordering married women to keep quiet in church. Through careful exegesis and theological comment this reading not only brings internal coherence to the text, but paints a picture of the apostle gripped by a vision for a new humanity &#34;in the Lord&#34; resulting in his refusal to compromise with the traditional views of his own society. Instead, as those who should identify with the crucified Christ, he exhorts the Corinthians to make &#34;love&#34; their aim, and thus to restore dignity and honor to women, the outsider, and the poor.</p><p>Lucy Peppiatt is the Principal of Westminster Theological Centre, based in Cheltenham, UK. She is the author of The Disciple: On Becoming Truly Human (2012).''I view Lucy Peppiatt's attempt to reinterpret these texts here . . . as both bold and significant. . . . It is a highly strategic argument and treatment. I expect it to break the broader discussion open in a new and constructive way.''<br>--from the foreword by Douglas Campbell<br><br>''In this book, Peppiatt sheds new and invigorating light on texts in 1 Corinthians that concern the thorny issue of Paul and women. She brings together exegetical skill, theological insight, and a vital concern for the historically contingent nature of Paul's argumentation, to offer a genuinely original and constructive analysis. So often the language of 1 Cor 11:2-16 and 14:33-35 proves to be a stumbling block for readers of Paul. Peppiatt, in ways that will inevitably be contentious, paves a plausible way out of the interpretive difficulties, and does so in a way that is both unexpected and attractive.''<br>--Chris Tilling, St. Mellitus College, London, UK<br><br>''Lucy Peppiatt offers in this volume a reading of Paul's advice on head coverings, women, and authority in the church. Her persuasive account of 1 Cor 11:2-16 rescues Paul from those who appeal to him in support of misogynistic theologies and confirms Paul's radical critique, rather than endorsement, of patriarchal culture. I commend it highly.''<br>--Murray Rae, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand<br><br>''This is a rigorous exegetical and theological analysis of a crucial and contested passage in Paul's letters, attentive to the complex and challenging interpretative options and implications entailed. Lucy Peppiatt's argument is a discerning and constructive contribution that requires careful consideration.''<br>--Tony Cummins, Trinity Western University, Langley, British Columbia, Canada --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>Courtney Crumrin Vol. 1: The Night Things (1)</h2><p>Get the first volume of this critically acclaimed series for only $10 as part of Oni&#39;s Square One program!

Thousands of people in the movie business made a Wizard-of-Oz living, working hidden levers to present an awe-inspiring display on theatre screens: Movie Stars! Hollywood made &#x2019;em and sold &#x2019;em daily, gamely producing a product for which its creators had no concrete explanation. Sometimes they made films that told the story of their own star-making business, and even then they couldn&#x2019;t say what exactly a movie star was. They just trusted that the audience wouldn&#x2019;t need an explanation because it would believe what it was seeing&#x2014;star presence&#x2014;could verify its own existence. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got that little something extra,&#x201d; muses James Mason in 1954&#x2019;s<i> A Star Is Born</i>, quoting actress Ellen Terry for credibility. Since he&#x2019;s talking about Judy Garland as he watches her sing &#x201c;The Man That Got Away,&#x201d; the point is made. (&#x201c;She has something!&#x201d; cries out Lowell Sherman when he spies waitress Constance Bennett in the earlier version of the story, <i>What Price Hollywood?</i>) Hollywood just <i>told</i> people that &#x201c;he&#x201d; or &#x201c;she&#x201d; or &#x201c;it&#x201d; (let&#x2019;s not forget Rin Tin Tin and Trigger) <i>had</i> &#x201c;that little something extra&#x201d; and let it go at that. As a definition, it wasn&#x2019;t much, but it was all anyone needed&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s no arguing with it. <br><br>The truth is that nobody&#x2014;either then or now&#x2014;can define what a movie star is except by specific example,[1] but the workaday world of moviemaking never gave up trying to figure it out. As soon as the business realized that moviegoers wanted to see stars, they grappled with trying to find a useful definition for the phenomenon of movie stardom, which is really not like any other kind. Marlon Brando called all their attempts &#x201c;a lot of frozen monkey vomit.&#x201d; Adding up the monkey&#x2019;s offerings, it&#x2019;s clear that over the years, Hollywood collected a sensible list of informed observations: A star has exceptional looks. Outstanding talent. A distinctive voice that can easily be recognized and imitated. A set of mannerisms. Palpable sexual appeal. Energy that comes down off the screen. Glamour. Androgyny. Glowing health and radiance. Panache. A single tiny flaw that mars their perfection, endearing them to ordinary people. Charm. The good luck to be in the right place at the right time (also known as just plain good luck). An emblematic quality that audiences believe is who they really are. The ability to make viewers &#x201c;know&#x201d; what they are thinking whenever the camera comes up close. An established type (by which is meant that they could believably play the same role over and over again). A level of comfort in front of the camera. And, of course, &#x201c;she has something,&#x201d; the bottom line of which is &#x201c;it&#x2019;s something you can&#x2019;t define.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s also the highly self-confident version of &#x201c;something you can&#x2019;t define&#x201d; that is a variation of Justice Potter Stuart&#x2019;s famous remark about pornography: &#x201c;I know it when I see it.&#x201d;<br><br>The last one makes sense. &#x201c;Seeing it&#x201d; is, in fact, the only reliable definition of stardom. The problem for the business was that audience members didn&#x2019;t all agree on what they saw. Some said that Greer Garson was a talented actress of ladylike grace and charm, but Pauline Kael called her &#x201c;one of the most richly syllabled queenly horrors of Hollywood.&#x201d; For their legions of fans (who still endure), Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald were the believable epitome of musical romance, but for No�l Coward they were &#x201c;an affair between a mad rocking horse and a rawhide suitcase.&#x201d;[2] Hollywood followed majority opinion, promoting the stars for which there was the most consistent audience agreement, while they worked hard to figure out the mystery of why one person (Clark Gable) could be loved by fans and someone who looked just like him (John Carroll) could not. It was Topic A in Hollywood, and studio bosses didn&#x2019;t discuss it only in isolated boardrooms. They read stars&#x2019; mail, quizzed fan clubs, and enlisted the help of movie magazines to create questionnaires about who the public liked and why. Answers from fans almost always boiled down to one thing: a popular movie star was perceived to have a tangible physical presence. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s so real. I almost feel I can reach out and touch him (Gable).&#x201d; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s adorable, very warm and real (Janet Gaynor).&#x201d; &#x201c;When she&#x2019;s on screen, you can&#x2019;t look at anyone else, and you feel you&#x2019;re right up there with her (Garbo).&#x201d; &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s just like someone I could know right here in Ohio, and if I needed anything he&#x2019;d step down and get it for me (Van Johnson).&#x201d; In other words, it&#x2019;s what Elvis Presley&#x2019;s character in <i>Jailhouse Rock</i> (1957) tells his co-star after he unexpectedly kisses her. She sputters about his &#x201c;cheap tactics,&#x201d; but he nails down the reason she&#x2019;ll accept him: &#x201c;That ain&#x2019;t tactics, honey. That&#x2019;s just the beast in me.&#x201d; Orson Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that this &#x201c;beast&#x201d; was best represented by Jimmy Cagney, who passed the real test of the term &#x201c;star quality&#x201d; because he could &#x201c;displace air . . . be a screen filler.&#x201d;<br><br>Fans confirmed their desire for this tangible presence, telling moviemakers what they responded to in movie stars really <i>was</i> something that seemed physical. Great movie stars were &#x201c;alive&#x201d; inside the frame. It was their home, their owned space. They were utterly at ease up there (and, sadly enough, often nowhere else). When Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, two consummate stars, sing &#x201c;Did Ya Evah?&#x201d; in <i>High Society</i> (1956), they prove the point. &#x201c;Did Ya Evah?&#x201d; was a tough assignment. Sinatra and Crosby had to sing, dance, hit their camera marks, respect the sophisticated Cole Porter lyrics, deliver scripted dialogue, stay within their characters, pretend to be slightly drunk, keep the beat of the orchestra playback, move around a specially designed library set with limited space while following a specific choreography that had to look improvised, and never forget that they were rivals for the audience&#x2019;s affection, &#x201c;Frankie&#x201d; and &#x201c;Bing.&#x201d; They have to watch out for each other in more ways than one. (Each was keenly aware of the other&#x2019;s star power.)<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear about poor Blanche? She got caught in an avalanche,&#x201d; sings Sinatra, carefully enunciating Porter&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;Game girl,&#x201d; mutters Crosby, riffing on the lyrics. &#x201c;She got up and finished fourth.&#x201d; Sinatra responds with his own ad lib: &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll dance!&#x201d; As he wobbles by, Crosby cautions, &#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t hurt yourself.&#x201d; These men are what stars are, doing what stars do. They seem as if they&#x2019;re making it up right in front of you. Looking at them performing &#x201c;Did Ya Evah?&#x201d; is a lesson in star definition: two hardworking professionals are executing a complicated musical assignment in order to look like two amateurs who&#x2019;re reeling through an accidental musical romp. Fifty years later, after they&#x2019;re both dead and gone, they are <i>still</i> alive inside the frame&#x2014;<i>still</i> making it appear that it&#x2019;s happening right in front of you, in the moment. The illusion of stardom is always the illusion of ease.<br><br>In the &#x201c;golden era&#x201d; of Hollywood, filmmakers knew that stardom required personalities like Crosby and Sinatra. Finding such stars was what the studios did. But how did they do it? Was there a formula? No. But there was a process. The hard part was that the process cost a great deal of money, and it was fraught with potential disasters. No matter what they did, no matter how smart they were about it, it could go wrong, because no one knew for sure what they were doing.<br><br>Moviemakers asked themselves many questions to define stardom. Was it luck, an accident of fate? When Alice Faye got appendicitis and had to be quickly replaced in <i>Down Argentine Way </i>(1940), her desperate studio (20th Century&#x2013;Fox) stuck a cute blonde who&#x2019;d been around town for nearly a decade into her part: Betty Grable. Given a chance by an appendix, Grable succeeded and became even more famous than Faye, lasting for an unprecedented decade at the top of popularity polls. All her life, Grable said her stardom happened because &#x201c;I was just lucky.&#x201d; The business asked itself, &#x201c;Was it only luck?&#x201d; Or did it require some special role that fit perfectly to what the actor could do? When five-time Olympic gold medal swimmer Johnny Weissmuller was cast as Tarzan, the role gave him a lifetime of fame. Since he was no actor (by his own frank admission), a movie with little dialogue and a lot of swimming fit him perfectly. No Tarzan, no Johnny?<br><br>Maybe actors became big stars because they seemed to incorporate their own opposites. Shirley Temple, that adorable little tot, was also a bossy brat who faked her way forward. If you met a kid like that in real life, you&#x2019;d want to smack her. Robert Walker seemed shy and innocent, but Hitchcock brought forward some disturbed quality that made him perfect as the evil Bruno in <i>Strangers on a Train</i> (1951). Barbara Stanwyck was tough but vulnerable. Tyrone Power was masculine yet feminine. Carole Lombard seemed like a fun pal, but she was the ultimate in sophisticated glamour. Maybe it was that a star had to find the perfect on-screen mate to supply some &#x201c;other half.&#x201d; As Katharine Hepburn famously said about Astaire and Rogers, &#x201c;He gives her class and she gives him sex.&#x201d; Was it some perfect co-starring that made magic and solidified the career? Would Flynn have made it without de Havilland? Eddy without MacDonald? Walter Pidgeon without Greer Garson? What could Abbott have been without Costello? Without Dorothy Lamour, the Hope-Crosby <i>Road</i> pictures wouldn&#x2019;t have worked as well. On-screen, Hope and Crosby were essentially disrespectful. They mocked the plot, the characters, the audience, and themselves in equal measure. They thumbed their noses at the filmmaking process itself, breaking the fourth wall and making self-referential and topical gags, but Lamour was always present to ground them. (They called her &#x201c;Momma.&#x201d;) She was beautiful, of course, and her songs broke their tension, but she dealt with Hope and Crosby calmly, in an unflappable manner. She was a gorgeous 1940s Margaret Dumont to leaven their Marxian antics, a center of cheerful gravitas.[3]<br><br>Maybe stardom wasn&#x2019;t about co-stars or other actors at all. Maybe it was a director&#x2019;s keen eye that saw possibilities in an actor that no one else saw&#x2014;as Josef von Sternberg claimed for his &#x201c;star-making&#x201d; skill with Marlene Dietrich? (William Holden said that without director Billy Wilder to shape his acting career, &#x201c;I would have been Henry Aldrich.&#x201d;) Maybe lighting could make a woman a star (Claudette Colbert), or a costume (Joan Crawford&#x2019;s famous Letty Lynton tea dress and, later on, her shoulder pads and ankle-strapped shoes), a memorable song (Rita Hayworth&#x2019;s &#x201c;Put the Blame on Mame&#x201d;), or an appearance in the movie version of a legendary best seller (Vivien Leigh in <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, 1939). Or maybe stardom was linked to some totally unpredictable minor little personal trait? Was it Elvis&#x2019;s hips or Harlow&#x2019;s platinum hair? Did Joan Bennett&#x2019;s dye job (from blond to brunette) change her from just another pretty girl into a seductive movie queen? Gary Cooper was a great kisser. He always did it right, bending his co-star back, holding on, and kissing the devil out of her.[4] He was a great-looking guy with lots of talent, but was it kissing that put him over? With Gable, was it all in the mustache?<br><br>In the end, the business forgot about questions and answers, and just kept its options open, realizing there would always be an unknown, abstract, and unpredictable part to the star-making process. They would always be reconciling opposing elements and taking big chances, treading a fine line between objective business plans and subjective audience response.<br><br>&#x201c;A star was born, not made,&#x201d; writes W. Robert LaVine in <i>In a Glamorous Fashion: The Fabulous Years of Hollywood Costume Design</i>. He was right, but also wrong. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t manufacture stars,&#x201d; said Joan Crawford (who was in a position to know). &#x201c;You manufacture toys.&#x201d; She was wrong, but also right. Studio moguls&#x2014;men such as Louis B. Mayer, Harry Cohn, Jack Warner, Darryl Zanuck, Sam Goldwyn et al.&#x2014;understood this contradiction and faced up to it daily. They succeeded because they accepted that there was no need to define stardom&#x2014;anything that worked was all the definition they&#x2019;d need. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got something!&#x201d; would do just fine. Since they <i>were</i> in business, they knew they&#x2019;d need to control as many things about creating movie stars as possible, but they&#x2019;d gamble on the rest. The intelligence of the Hollywood businessmen who came to this conclusion&#x2014;and their astounding nerve&#x2014;is seldom acknowledged.<br><br>And so Hollywood, with its factory-like studio system, cheerfully made a living manufacturing a product it couldn&#x2019;t define, confident that someone out there (&#x201c;the little people&#x201d;) would do it for them&#x2014;and pay them for the privilege. They busied themselves looking for a Judy Garland to put up on the screen so the audience could find her and say &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got that little something you can&#x2019;t define but we can recognize when we see it because it&#x2019;s that little something extra.&#x201d; They would look for actors and actresses who could project the mysterious &#x201c;x factor&#x201d; of stardom. It was a crackpot idea, all right, but against all odds, they made it work because whatever it was, the x factor <i>was</i> viewable.<br><br>In fact, there are examples of the x factor popping off the screen all over film history. It&#x2019;s the infrared in the dark of the movie house.[5] Bette Davis, even in her fake-blonde days, outshines everyone around her in forgotten movies like <i>So Big</i> (1932), <i>Housewife</i> (1934), and <i>Ex-Lady</i> (1933). Jimmy Cagney&#x2019;s animal magnetism wipes everyone out of the frame even in small parts in <i>Doorway to Hell</i> (1930) and <i>Other Men&#x2019;s Women</i> (1931). A young Esther Williams jumps out in an MGM wartime short entitled <i>Inflation</i>, which she made after her initial screen test and just before her first feature assignment. She&#x2019;s a beginner with no acting experience&#x2014;a swimmer, for heaven&#x2019;s sake&#x2014; paired with a terrific actor, Edward Arnold. Arnold plays the devil, tempting Williams to break the rules of rationing and buy herself a fur coat. He gets totally lost when Williams confidently struts around in the coat, flashing her x factor. (Pressed to explain why such an inexperienced swimming champion could be turned into a big box office movie star, Arthur Freed searched hard for reasons. Finally he came up with &#x201c;She&#x2019;s cheerful!"[6])<br><b>NOTES</b><br>[1] Actor Frederic March didn't much like Joan Crawford, but asked to define stardom, he mentioned her name and said: "<i>She</i> was a star."<br>[2] In talking about movie stardom, it's important not to confuse the old studio system in the Hollywood of the 1930s and 1940s with the one that exists today. "Star" history has to be divided into "then" and "now" because the importance of stardom has diminished over time. The stars of silent film and of the great studio system were gods and goddesses. The public revered them, but they had to earn their stardom. Today anybody's a star who can get his or her name in front of thet credits by negotiating for it. The next-door neighbor in a sitcom is a star. The term is the bottom rung of show business, and to compensate for its devaluation, there is a tarted-up power system of star levels&#x2014;an upping of wattage. Above "star" is "superstar" and above "superstar" is "megastar." By this standard, Bogart and Davis and Cooper and Cagney are gigastars. As Baryshnikov said about Fred Astaire, "He's dancing. The rest of us are doing something else."<br>[3] Lamour's sense of humor can be seen in <i>On Our Merry Way</i> (1948), in which, playing a movie star who does jungle movies (i.e., herself in a spoof of herself), she sings the unforg...</p><h2>Lucifer Vol. 1: Cold Heaven (Lucifer, 1)</h2><p>The #1 NEW YORK TIMES best-selling author of THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES Holly Black picks up the thread from legendary creators Neil Gaiman, Mike Carey, and Peter Gross, as she and artist Lee Garbett resurrect an iconic VERTIGO antihero in LUCIFER VOL. 1: COLD HEAVEN.<br> &nbsp;<br> SPEAK OF THE DEVIL<br> &nbsp;<br> Once he was the Morningstar, first and most beautiful of the heavenly host.

The freedom to question is an indispensable and sacred practice that is absolutely vital to the health of our communities.According to author David Dark, when religion won&#x2019;t tolerate questions, objections, or differences of opinion, and when it only brings to the table threats of excommunication, violence, and hellfire, it obstructs our ability to think, empathize, and live lives of authenticity and genuine engagement.The God of the Bible not only encourages questions; the God of the Bible demands them. If that were not so, we wouldn&#x2019;t live in a world of such rich, God-given complexity in which wide-eyed wonder is part and parcel of the human condition. The possibility of redemption and revolution depends on the questions we ask of God, governments, media, and everyday economies. It is by way of the questions that we resist the conformity that deadens and come alive to visions that redeem.</p><p><b>What Other Authors and Friends Are Saying:</b><p> David Dark is my favorite critic of the people's culture of America and the Christian faith. He brings a deep sense of reverence to every book he reads, every song he hears, every movie he sees, but it is a discerning reverence--attentive to truth and Jesus wherever he comes on them. He is also a reliable lie detector. And not a dull sentence in the book.<br> <b>Eugene Peterson</b>, professor emeritus of spiritual theology, translator of <i>The Message</i></p><p> David Dark is one of our wisest authors, and I plan to read everything he writes. The Sacredness of Questioning Everything will comfort questioners, doubters, and skeptics with assurance that their questions can be faithful, and it will challenge the complacent with an ethical summons to wonder. It invites everything to give life--and faith--a second thought, and did I mention that it's beautifully written?<br> <b>Brian McLaren</b>, author of <i>Everything Must Change</i></p><p> Brilliant and charming and insightful as always, Dark comforts both my soul and my mind with this synthesis, part memoir and part essay, of the culture around us and the culture within us.<br> <b>Phyllis Tickle</b>, author of <i>The Great Emergence</i></p><p> We will never find the answers until we begin to ask the right questions. Most of us are skeptical of self-righteous folks (whether pastors or politicians) who try to force their answers into you as if truth was an enema. And if there is anything we can learn from both liberals and conservatives, it's that you can have all the right answers and still be mean people. This is not a book of answers. Here is a book of questions--question everything ... including this book.<br> <b>Shane Claiborne</b>, author of <i>The Irresistible Revolution</i> and <i>Jesus for President</i>, activist, and recovering sinner</p><p> This is what I need: a far-reaching Christianity that's not just for the Shiny Happy People but for me, questioning and doubting and trying to live into the mystery. I couldn't ask for a better fellow pilgrim than brainiac David Dark, who feels as comfortable mining The Office and The Colbert Report as he does Dostoevsky and Flannery O'Connor. This book is for everyone who quietly suspects that God is a whole lot bigger than the church would have us believe.<br> <b>Jana Riess</b>, author of <i>What Would Buffy Do?</i></p><p> In <i>The Sacredness of Questioning Everything</i>, David Dark serves up a unique blend of pop culture and high culture, generously seasoned with religious texts. The result is an immensely readable, profoundly subversive, and deeply prophetic book.<br> <b>Andrew Bacevich</b>, author of <i>The Limits of Power</i></p><p> In <i>The Sacredness of Questioning Everything</i>, David Dark travels the lonesome highways of the American soul and finds signs of grace where many of us see only despair. Carry this book with you as a guide through these uncertain times.<br> <b>Charles Marsh</b>, author of <i>Wayward Christian Soldiers</i></p><p> David Dark is a brilliant and respected cultural critic, and here, in this new work, he has done something that very few evangelical writers have done: he truly invites us--no, he calls us--to the holy task of thinking all manner of things through, of saying yes and no, of questioning and seeking and discerning what is most true. We need this kind of feisty, literate, and (dare I say it?) prophetic call, and we will be better--as people and as a Christian community and as a culture--if we take up this unsettling and liberating challenge.<br> <b>Byron Borger</b>, owner of Hearts &amp; Minds bookstore, Dallastown, Pennsylvania</p><p> Dark wanders through the landscape of theological inquiry with brilliance, taking us into uncharted valleys where questioning, confusion, doubt, and promise intermingle. This book is a call to action, a resounding yell of encouragement, to all types of Christians.<br> <b>Christopher R.

With disastrous consequences for both . . . and their descendants. Half of the descendants have great fates, and the other half have terrible ones.<br><br> Now, Tumble Wilson and Blue Montgomery are determined to fix their ancestors&#x2019; mistakes and banish the bad luck that&#x2019;s followed them around for all of their lives.

They come reeking of their bug repellents and their sunscreens, and the<i>clicker-snap</i> of their cameras nibbles away at the song of the swamp until I wonder if they can hear it at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my memory, the humans who traveled the Okefenokee were a different sort. These new ones are less afraid. More curious. And, on the whole, they are quite a bit plumper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would be a lie to say I have not felt the stirrings of temptation. Especially in the deep summer, when the sun glazes them with sweat so that they glisten, juicy and bright as silver fish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scrumptious, but I resist. My business with mankind is not, strictly speaking, that of the predator.</p><p>I do have to remind myself of that when they come carrying maps. How they love those little guides with their safe paths through the swamp all dotted out and color-coded. Acres of prairie and blackwater and cypress and pine captured as lines on bits of paper. Made small as gnats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Such arrogant morsels, you humans. That&#x2019;s something that hasn&#x2019;t changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the beginning, to a couple of humans long dead but still causing trouble for their descendants. Almira LaFayette, Walcott Montgomery&#x2014;names from a story that is only now approaching its end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s been two hundred years, and I still remember the taste of them on the night air. Thick, greedy, sweet with desperation. When they met on the edge of the swamp, the red sickle moon was cutting a hole in the black of the sky.</p><p><i>My</i> moon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And in its bloody light those two bad people were looking for an easy way out of the messes they&#x2019;d made. Montgomery was a horse thief. LaFayette was a murderous young bride. He had robbed a militiaman, and she had shot her husband in the gut with a revolver three days after the wedding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps they had their reasons. I didn&#x2019;t care to ask. What matters is that they ran from justice and toward me, and they reached my island at the same time.</p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Precisely</i> the same time. An irksome situation for me and a tricky one for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I offer only one change of fate. Only one chance at a new future. Those are the rules, and they can be terribly sharp when broken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well. At least they didn&#x2019;t use maps to find me. Even Montgomery and LaFayette knew that much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Creatures like me don&#x2019;t fit in between a cartographer&#x2019;s lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Creatures like me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We can only be found in the places where maps dare not go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Blue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue Montgomery almost missed the sign. Kudzu was vining up its wooden posts, and its paint had begun to peel. It looked more like part of the wilderness around it than something made by human hands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But his dad seemed to know where the turn was even in the dark. He steered the truck off the asphalt and onto dirt, and in the shine of the headlights, Blue had just enough time to read, Welcome to Murky Branch, GA. and, population: 339.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Bout two miles to your granny&#x2019;s house from here!&#x201d; Alan Montgomery raised his voice over the rumble of the washboard road. &#x201c;I used to run from our front door all the way out to the sign. Back when I was your age. I could make it in under twelve minutes. Not bad at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and gunned the truck&#x2019;s engine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue watched the woods speed by. His dad had been like this ever since they&#x2019;d left the hotel in Atlanta. Talky. Casual. As if he didn&#x2019;t know that every mile marker they passed stung Blue like a wasp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were no more mile markers out here, though. No cell phone reception either. Most of the world had no idea that Murky Branch existed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The road curved, and through a break in the pines, Blue saw the house. Three stories of ghostly white paint and wraparound porches were illuminated by a moon that was close to full.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your granny&#x2019;s going to be so glad to see you,&#x201d; said his dad. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been nagging me to bring you around for forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He whipped the truck onto the gravel driveway just as the glowing numbers on the dashboard clock changed to read midnight. Rocks flew up to ping against the doors. Blue winced, imagining the scratches and dings in the new paint, but he didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dad had taken a break from racing last year, but now that he was planning to get back on the track, he only had one speed. Fast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The truck passed an old chicken coop that was cooping a mower instead of chickens, then a shed with a roll of rusting barbed wire propped against one wall. Blue caught a glimpse of the huge garden beside the house. It was filled with tomato cages, silver pinwheels, and chin-high corn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dad dodged a sprinkler, bounced the truck over a coiled hose, and stopped inches from the trunk of a giant pecan tree. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, letting go of the wheel, &#x201c;the place hasn&#x2019;t changed much. You need help getting the&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it,&#x201d; Blue muttered, opening his own door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue&#x2019;s right arm had been in a cast for weeks. He&#x2019;d tried to stand up to a bully at school and, in hindsight, that hadn&#x2019;t been the best idea. Fighting usually wasn&#x2019;t when you were literally destined to lose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the arm would be fine. Sometimes, when the itching let up, Blue forgot that he was wearing the cast at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He reached into the truck&#x2019;s backseat, but his dad was already there, stretching to grab the overstuffed duffel bag. &#x201c;Let me take that for you, Skeeter.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He set off toward the house, and Blue followed, dragging his feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sounds were strange. In Atlanta, even at night, sirens and horns had screamed past the hotel where they&#x2019;d been living, but here, the darkness was loud with chirring insects and frog song. Blue felt like his ears had been tuned to the wrong channel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He reached the edge of the porch&#x2019;s wide cement steps and looked up. He had a vague memory of the Montgomery house from when he was a little kid. But it was eerie now and unfamiliar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Carved over the front door&#x2019;s lintel was a scene that had been painted over so many times the finer details were obscured. Two figures, a man and a woman, were shaking hands under a crescent moon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The columns that supported the porches were carved as well, some of them into cranes with raised beaks and others into alligators standing on the tips of their tails. The gator nearest Blue had had one of its eyes drilled out. It looked like someone had gouged the creature&#x2019;s soul right out of the socket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue climbed the steps and took in the rest of the porch. A pair of worn-out athletic shoes, dirty with grass clippings, had been left beside the mat. The door had a scuffed bottom and etched windows on either side. He couldn&#x2019;t see through the filmy curtains, but he figured everyone in the house must be asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thunk.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue turned. His dad had dropped the duffel bag onto the porch boards. He was rocking back and forth on his heels like he always did after a long drive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he caught Blue&#x2019;s stare, he stopped. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue bent to pick up the bag with his good hand. He tried to lift it onto his shoulder in one smooth motion, though its weight made his arm burn. He thought he&#x2019;d managed pretty well, but even in the dark, he could see the way the corners of his dad&#x2019;s eyes creased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that heavy,&#x201d; Blue said. &#x201c;I bet I&#x2019;m as tough as any of the other cursed Montgomerys.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dad was looking everywhere but at him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve talked about this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not expecting you to get involved when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<i>if </i>it happens the way they say it will. You&#x2019;re only here to visit your granny while I work some things out. The timing&#x2019;s a coincidence is all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue wished he would stop lying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The red moon only appeared once every hundred years. According to family legends, on that night one person could travel into the swamp and claim a great new fate. And when you were cursed&#x2014;as Blue and half of the other Montgomerys were&#x2014;a new fate was worth the risk. It couldn&#x2019;t be an accident that his dad had decided to leave him here this summer, when the moon was due to rise again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; his dad said, scuffing his feet against the mat, &#x201c;go on in. Your granny hasn&#x2019;t locked a door in seventy years.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to come in with me? To say hello to everyone?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dad just stood there, tall and silent. He was sandy-haired, like Blue, but lately it seemed that was the only thing they had in common. Alan was one of the lucky Montgomerys. One of the gifted ones. He had a talent for winning, and as a racer, he&#x2019;d been unbeatable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue, on the other hand, couldn&#x2019;t even win a game of tic-tac-toe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; his dad said at last. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to be gettin&#x2019; on.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue wondered if they were going to hug each other good-bye. He kind of wanted to, even though none of this was fair. He took a step forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dad turned away. &#x201c;Got to be gettin&#x2019; on,&#x201d; he said again. He stomped down the stairs and paused at the bottom to look back over his shoulder. &#x201c;Tell your granny I said hello. And your cousins.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t pay too much attention to anything your granny might say about me. And whatever you do,<i>don&#x2019;t</i> tell her I&#x2019;m taking up racing again. She&#x2019;s got this way of looking at things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it&#x2019;s soft, that&#x2019;s what, and lord knows you don&#x2019;t need more of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue stiffened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dad was scraping one of his shoes against the patchy grass. &#x201c;Bye.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue didn&#x2019;t reply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alan strode back to the pickup. Blue had picked the color. Golden brown. He could see the flecks of glitter in the paint even in the dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue cleared his throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you soon, right?&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be back by the end of the summer?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The truck door opened with a <i>clonk</i>, and his dad pulled himself up into the high leather seat. &#x201c;Just take care of yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But they were supposed to take care of each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The door slammed. Blue lifted his cast in a wave, but he was too late. The truck had already taken off across the cluttered yard. Its headlights illuminated the green plastic mailbox at the end of the driveway, and then it was gone.</p><p>Blue was alone on the porch of a house he only half remembered, on a night full of sounds that were all wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stared up at the carving over the door. Once upon a long time ago, one of Blue&#x2019;s ancestors had won the great fate for himself under the red sickle moon. Walcott Montgomery had gone into the Okefenokee Swamp a poor man on the run from his enemies, and he had come out of it different. Luckier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wealth, health, long life&#x2014;Walcott had had it all. And he&#x2019;d changed the fortunes of every Montgomery who came after him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you believed the stories, it wasn&#x2019;t entirely Walcott&#x2019;s fault that half of the family had ended up cursed. The woman in the carving&#x2014;Almira LaFayette&#x2014;had been there, too. She&#x2019;d made it to the hidden island at the heart of the swamp at the same time as Walcott. They&#x2019;d fought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things had gone wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it would be someone else&#x2019;s turn this time. And if Blue could be that someone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>How</i>, though? Other Montgomerys would be descending on Murky Branch. He assumed it would mostly be the cursed relatives. The famous actors, millionaires, and geniuses didn&#x2019;t need to show up, did they?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But even though the Mongomerys who came might have their own terrible fates to contend with, none of them were born to lose. Spelling bees, video games, hide-and-seek&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter how simple the competition. Blue couldn&#x2019;t win.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His arm itched and ached inside its cast, and as he scratched at the plaster, he realized how tired he was of being himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He looked around the empty porch, and the dirty athletic shoes beside the door pulled at his eyes. None of his own shoes were great for running. He&#x2019;d only ever been a spectator, and running shoes were for racers. Weren&#x2019;t they?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weren&#x2019;t they for people like his dad, who was probably halfway back to the highway by now, driving like he was about to cross yet another finish line?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Driving away from Blue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thunk.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue let the duffel bag fall hard. He kicked off his flip-flops. He stomped over to the shoes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Racing shoes, </i>he thought.<i>Not-for-Blue shoes. </i>And when he stuffed his bare feet inside of the shoes, they fit. Like they had been waiting for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like they were ready to try something new.</p></p><h2>Lesbian TANTRIC SEX: Sex, Sex Positions, Sex Guide, Sexuality, Tantric Sex, Lesbian Sex, Gay Sex</h2><p>If you want to experience heightened states of sexual pleasure, deep connection with your partner and be at one with the universe, you will find you have come to the right place!

The diner quickly becomes famous for Annie's signature dish, a pasta salad she christens Poke Salad, invented, unsurprisingly, on a Thursday. It is notably not a Thursday when, many years later, Annie loses her dear husband and with him her zeal for Poke Salad, feeding the community, and the diner. Without Mario or the diner, Annie retreats into a solitary, heartbroken life&#x2014;until the Thursday she discovers an abandoned kitten on her porch. The cat, whom Annie names Thursday, becomes her constant companion and reinvigorates her culinary spirit. Before long, Annie and the townsfolk reopen the diner, which features Annie's Poke Salad and a new feline entertainer. After an accident in the kitchen results in a terrifically ugly but wonderfully aromatic pasta dish, a surprise guest to the diner puts Annie and her new "Ugly Pasta" on the map. Rendered in colored pencil and acetone markers in Polacco's signature style, the illustrations are bold and colorful and teem with activity. However, what begins as a sweet and heartfelt family tale takes an unexpected and outlandish turn with the introduction of a Guy Fieri-esque TV host. Featured is a photo of the author with her cat, Thursday, who inspired the story, as well as Polacco's own recipe for Ugly Pasta. VERDICT Less compelling than Polacco's typical autobiographical or historical fare, this lighthearted selection should still please her most dedicated fans.&#x2014;Lauren Strohecker, McKinley Elementary School, Elkins Park, PA</p><h2>Eating Disorders: Hope for Hungering Souls</h2><p>God&#39;s Word has much to say about modern day problems, and that includes the spectrum of eating disorders.

In it, Peter M Burfeind builds off the foundations of Hans Jonas, Denis de Rougement, Norman Cohn, William Voegelin, Carl Jung, and Harold Bloom, each of whom saw the effects of Gnosticism in contemporary American (and Western) life. He explores the spiritual mechanisms going on behind everything from transgenderism to so-called &#34;contemporary worship,&#34; from the deconstructionist movement to the role pop music and media have in our culture, from progressive politics to the Emergent Church. Particularly challenging is Burfeind&#39;s claim that both progressivism and Neo-evangelicalism -- seemingly at odds in the &#34;culture wars&#34; -- actually share the same Gnostic roots. Burfeind&#39;s book is a tour de force through contemporary rock, pop, movies, television, politics, and religion showing how many of the values driving these cultural elements are informed by the ancient esoteric teachings of Gnosticism. Burfeind marshals a ton of surprising evidence to make his case, taking us through ancient and Medieval history, through the Enlightenment and Romantic periods, to today. Those willing to grapple with the philosophical and spiritual positions of the fathers of contemporary American life will be rewarded. Gnostic America is a must read for those who sense a new &#34;spiritual but not religious&#34; religion has arisen in America, but who can&#39;t put their finger on what exactly this religion is. Burfeind commits the sacrilege of defining a religion that claims to be &#34;beyond&#34; definition. More importantly, he poses the question, if the spiritual trends of contemporary culture are indeed a religion, what First Amendment safeguards remain for those who haven&#39;t &#34;evolved&#34; with the emerging new consciousness, but choose to remain stuck in supposedly retrograde paradigms of thought?</p><p>Peter Burfeind serves as pastor at Holy Cross Lutheran Church and Student Ministry at the University of Toledo.

He earned a degree in Journalism from the University of Maryland and spent over 30 years covering local, college, and professional sports. He won several awards from the Maryland-DC-Delaware Press Association for his writing.&nbsp;McNamara was one of five employees of the Annapolis Capital who were gunned down in a mass shooting at the newspaper on June 28, 2018. He was 56 years old. The University's Philip Merrill College of Journalism established an Award and a Scholarship in his name for sports journalism. He was inducted into the Maryland High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame; the Press Area at the City of Bowie is named in his honor, his name is included on the Newseum's Journalists Wall; and he was among Time Magazine's Persons of the Year for 2018."One of the things I genuinely looked forward to whenever I attended a Maryland basketball game was having a pre-game sit-down with John. We'd catch up on things and then start talking hoops. I always walked away from the conversation feeling smarter&#x2015;or at least more knowledgeable than before. John knew everything and everyone on the subject of local hoops&#x2015;high school, college, and, probably, schoolyard. What always came through was how much he loved it. Going to games at Maryland will never be the same for me without John. This book will let me carry some of those happy memories with me forever." <br>&#x2015;<b>John Feinstein</b>, columnist for <i>The Washington Post</i> and CBSsportsradio.com<p><br><br>"It's sadly rare to come across sportswriters who are both expert in their field and generous with their knowledge. It's equally rare, amid the sporting world's current fixation on point spreads and fantasy leagues, to find sportswriters who invest the time and care to understand and portray athletes as people rather than assets. John was that rare gem&#x2015;an expert in DC-area sports, a generous colleague, and a caring human being. It was my privilege to have shared press boxes with John from 2011 on. Now, his expertise and insight are shared with all in <i>The Capital of Basketball</i>." <br>&#x2015;<b>Liz Clarke</b>, sportswriter for <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p><br><br>"<i>The Capital of Basketball</i> provides important details on the players and coaches that made Washington DC famous, including Danny Ferry, Johnny Dawkins, Grant Hill, Billy King, and Tommy Amaker who helped take Duke to national prominence. Those of us at Duke and around the country know a trip to DC during basketball season is a chance to see some of the country's best talent on the court." <br>&#x2015;<b>Mike Krzyzewski</b>, men's basketball head coach, Duke University</p><p><br><br>"In <i>The Capital of Basketball</i>, John McNamara has crafted fascinating and revealing insights into a pivotal time in the history of basketball and the city of Washington. John's reporting was always first-rate. No one saw the game like he did. Here he tells the stories of all the great teams, the great players, the big games, often told against a backdrop of the social convulsions that brought major changes on and off the court in a city where basketball has always meant so much. John traces the history of Washington-area basketball from its beginnings all the way through the 20th century. He tells the tales with deft writing and snappy anecdotes to bring us all into the gymnasium. This book is awesome; it's special. It's a real keeper. I love this book! This is a must read for anyone who wants to know about the game of basketball." <br>&#x2015;<b>Morgan Wootten</b>, basketball coach, DeMatha Catholic High School</p><p><br><br>"<i>The Capital of Basketball</i> is a must read. What a great history lesson on the greatness of the DMV (DC, Maryland, and Virginia) and its impact on basketball. Len Bias was everything to us! But it's not just about the unbelievable players from the DMV but also the extraordinary coaches who helped lead us to greatness. John Mac, what a pleasure being part of your book and a part of the great history in Prince George's County basketball." <br>&#x2015;<b>Walt "the Wizard" Williams</b>, men's basketball sideline reporter, University of Maryland Terrapins</p><p><br><br>"When it came to basketball, John blended the knowledge of a veteran coach with the passion of a loyal fan. He knew the game but he never forgot what it is to be a fan, and it shows in <i>The Capital of Basketball</i>, which tells the story of this hotbed of high school hoops. He imparted his basketball stories with insider information and wit. He was a basketball writer's basketball writer." <br>&#x2015;<b>Jeff Barker</b>, sportswriter for <i>The Baltimore Sun</i></p><p><br><br>"Arguably, the most significant high school game in DC history took place in 1965 between my high school, DeMatha Stags, coached by Morgan Wootten, and New York City's Power Memorial High School, led by Lew Alcindor (aka Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), the most sought-after player in the country. Played before a capacity crowd of 12,500 at Cole Field House on the campus of the University of Maryland, DeMatha, in a nail biter, won by a single point&#x2015;snapping Power's 71-game win streak.

Gary Moore's book about his father--a baseball phenom whose future in the majors was cut short by World War II and a fateful occurrence during a top secret mission for the U.S. Navy--is a warm-hearted memoir of faded dreams and new hope that is destined for the bestseller lists. Filled with memorable characters from an extraordinary time in our country's history, it is a truly redemptive story that will be read and reread for generations to come.</p><p><b>Gary W. Moore</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed book <i>Playing with the Enemy:&nbsp;A Baseball Prodigy, World War II, and the Long Journey Home</i>, which won the 2006 Military Writers Society of America Book of the Year. Moore is also a contributing author for <i>Chicken Soup for the Father &amp; Son Soul</i>. He was awarded the prestigious Sam Walton Leadership Award in 1996. He has made appearances on CNN, ABC, and CBS.<br><br>In three months, <b>Jim Morris</b> went from being a 35 year-old high school teacher to a major league baseball pitcher. He wrote the foreword to Gary W. Moore&#x2019;s <i>Playing with the Enemy: A Baseball Prodigy, World War II, and the Long Journey Home</i>.<i>Starred Review.</i> In 1940, at just 15 years old, small-town baseball star Gene Moore was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers, who saw in him the potential to become one of the great catchers of all time. Before that could happen, though, WWII intervened. Gene's story, a surprising paean to the power and humanity of a game, is told here by his son, a first-time author who exhibits the confidence and pacing of a pro. His gripping material certainly helps: after several years overseas in the Navy's touring baseball team, Gene was brought back to Louisiana and assigned to guard secret German POWs, whose U-boat was captured just days before the storming of Normandy. There, Gene teaches his German captives how to play baseball, with a number of unintended and life-altering consequences. When Gene's finally able to return home to Sesser, Ill., he's "on crutches, depressed and embarrassed," holing up in the local bar and prompting one bartender to lament, "he's become one of us, when we were hoping he would make us like him." Gene's journey from promise to despair and back again, set against a long war and an even longer post-war recovery, retains every bit of its vitality and relevance, a 20th-century epic that demonstrates how, sometimes, letting go of a dream is the only way to discover one's great fortune.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was cool that fall and he would have done well with a heavier fabric, but maybe that was just the octogenarian&#x2019;s style&#x2014;or maybe his only suit. He was napping, talking in his sleep. The unintelligible words came from his lips like a sporadic spoken-word song in another language. Maybe it was a foreign tongue. &nbsp; <br><br>Six rows back, I knew, sat a behemoth of a man wearing black-jean overalls and a heavy, long-sleeved blue-and-white-checkered work shirt. From a thick steel chain around the big man&#x2019;s neck depended a real horseshoe that had never been attached to any hoof.The man was in his forties, over four hundred pounds, with red hair and the raspberry and cream&#x2013;colored skin of a Norseman. His regular breathing, when you got within two rows, was loud enough to hear over the clacking of metal wheels on metal tracks. &nbsp; <br><br>At the front of the car, in a seat facing backward, there perched a small black woman who was somewhere around my age, clutching a red, yellow, and green calico carpetbag by its worn brown leather handle. The fifty-something lady looked worried but thisseemed like a regular state of affairs&#x2014;not any specific problem that plagued her at that point in time. &nbsp; <br><br>Specific problems have always been my stock-in-trade. As a young man I delivered this unwanted commodity; nowadays I remove it&#x2014;for a price. &nbsp; <br><br>A woman came through the semiautomatic door behind the worried grandmother. This potential new resident of our low-occupancy car was harder to define. &nbsp; <br><br>She was beautiful. Her bright skin was the russet brown I associated with the Caribbean, her hair was untreated and a little wild, and her eyes a color somewhere between brown and bronze. I noticed her eyes because this was the third time she&#x2019;d gone pastgazing at me, considering, and then rejecting whatever thought it was that those eyes harbored. Past thirty but nowhere near the next decade, she&#x2019;d still be lovely when she reached the age of the sleeping man who muttered across the aisle. &nbsp; <br><br>I wondered what she might have asked if I had met her expectations. This thought caused me to look around just in time to see her stop at the behemoth&#x2019;s row. She asked a question and he grumbled something. She asked something else and he shook his headvehemently, gestured with his left hand, and then turned away&#x2014;which was no mean feat for a man his size. &nbsp; <br><br>She nodded at him, almost a bow, and made her way to the end of the car. There she punched the chrome plate that engaged the sliding door. &nbsp; <br><br>The passing thought that it might have been nice to hear her question firsthand was soon displaced by the certainty that whatever she said would not have improved my life. In my experience beautiful strangers rarely give as much as they take and they almostalways ask for more. &nbsp;<br><br> After she was gone I pulled out my cell phone and entered the characters M-A-R, then touched a button that had the image of an upright receiver emblazed upon it. The phone rang once and she answered. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;McGill and Son detective agency.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> I had never asked her to answer the phone like that but Mardi had her own aesthetic and she had become, in just a few years, an indispensable part of my office. &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Mardi.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Mr. McGill. How are you?&#x201d; Her voice was soft like a satin finish on polished steel. &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just fine. I get anything on my New York Literary Review ad?&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;No, sir. I checked just this noon.&#x201d; <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t expect an answer. William Williams was in the wind. It was no great loss; like the dollar bet on a hundred-million-dollar Lotto&#x2014;you were bound to lose but you had to play. &nbsp;<br><br>"A man named Hiram Stent called asking for an appointment anytime today,&#x201d; Mardi murmured.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his problem?&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t say but it sounded pretty, I don&#x2019;t know . . . urgent.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not coming in today,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going straight to the sanatorium from the station. Give him a morning slot, first thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Are you finished with the Martinez case?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Did it turn out okay?&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;He ran once,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s to say he won&#x2019;t do it again? Twill in?&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said but her tone said more. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; &nbsp; &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t call in today. I think he&#x2019;s probably at home studying the tapes you had me give him.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> There was something off in Mardi&#x2019;s voice, something that had to do with my favorite son. I would have asked about it but just at that moment I felt a presence at my side. Looking up, I saw the brilliant vision of the beautiful woman who flitted aroundour car like a hesitant butterfly over a sticky flower. <br><br>Her dress was a shade deeper than coral, and though it wasn&#x2019;t tight it expressed her figure just fine. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to call you back, M, something just came up here.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;On the train?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;just somebody wanting a section of my paper.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;See you tomorrow,&#x201d; she said, and I broke the connection. <br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; I greeted while putting the phone in the breast pocket of my all-purpose blue suit. &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to interrupt you,&#x201d; she said. Her voice was somewhere in the lower register of gold. Her black satin purse was cinched at the top like a miniature burlap potato sack. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;No problem. I was just calling in to the office.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She glanced at the door behind her. &#x201c;Um . . . can I sit next to you?&#x201d; <br><br>I was on the aisle so she was asking for a window seat&#x2014;with a buffer. &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that what you asked Haystack Calhoun back there?&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t get the cultural reference but still understood the joke. Smiling and frowning at the same time, she said, &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s afraid of girls.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Good for him. Some men never learn that lesson.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Have you?&#x201d; the nameless beauty asked. &nbsp; <br><br>If I believed in angels they wouldn&#x2019;t be the sweet beneficent kind with fluffy wings and halos but rather haughty, removed Valkyries that tore the soul from your dying breast. That kind of angel would have asked the question she put to me. And, I knew,I should have answered like the colossus with the horseshoe necklace. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Leonid,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Leonid McGill.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;May I sit on the other side of you, Mr. McGill?&#x201d; she asked. &nbsp; <br><br>If I wanted her name I was going to have to work for it. &nbsp; <br><br>I grabbed my brown rucksack from the empty seat next to me and then stood making a gesture with my left hand, the same and yet the opposite of the behemoth. She smiled and brushed past me. At that proximity I got a whiff of something both acrid and sweet,like some ancient forests I&#x2019;d been in. It was a mild scent that caused a strong reaction in a section of my heart that had almost been forgotten. &nbsp; <br><br>When she was installed there next to me I knew that the next week or so would be trouble. I smiled and laughed a little. She nodded and then grinned.</p><h2>Steps</h2><p>Winner of the National Book Award for Fiction<br><br>From the esteemed author of the classics The Painted Bird and Being There comes this award-winning novel about one man's sexual and sensual experiences, the fabric from which his life has been woven.<br><br>Jerzy Kosinski's classic vision of moral and sexual estrangement brilliantly captures the disturbing undercurrents of modern politics and culture.

All-American boy John Norman Collins was arrested, tried, and convicted of the strangulation murder of Karen Sue Beineman. The other murders attributed to Collins never went to trial, with one exception, and soon became cold cases. With the benefit of fifty years of hindsight, hundreds of vintage newspaper articles, thousands of police reports, and countless interviews, Terror in Ypsilanti: John Norman Collins Unmasked tells the stories of the other victims, recreates the infamous trial that took Collins off the streets, and details Collins&#39; time spent in prison.

Miller offers students a different approach to conceptualizing and treating mental illness. Miller critically examines reigning orthodoxies, such as our tendency to pathologize psychological difficulties and to downplay or ignore subjective experiences of human suffering. He reviews theoretical bases, methods of diagnosis and assessment, and treatments that have long produced successful outcomes, yet have too often been denigrated or ignored by proponents of the dominant approaches to mental health care.

Newspaper reporting has long shaped the way that we see the world, played key roles in exposing scandals, and has even been alleged to influence international policy. The past several years have seen the newspaper industry in a state of crisis, with Twitter and Facebook ushering in the rise of citizen journalism and a deprofessionalization of the industry, plummeting readership and revenue, and municipal and regional papers shuttering or being absorbed into corporate behemoths. Now billionaires, most with no journalism experience but lots of power and strong views, are stepping in to purchase newspapers, both large and small. <br><br>This addition to the <em>What Everyone Needs to Know�</em> series looks at the past, present and future of journalism, considering how the development of the industry has shaped the present and how we can expect the future to roll out. It addresses a wide range of questions, from whether objectivity was only a conceit of late twentieth century reporting, largely behind us now; how digital technology has disrupted journalism; whether newspapers are already dead to the role of non-profit journalism; the meaning of "transparency" in reporting; the way that private interests and governments have created their own advocacy journalism; whether social media is changing journalism; the new social rules of old media outlets; how franchised media is addressing the problem of disappearing local papers; and the rise of citizen journalism and hacker journalism. It will even look at the ways in which new technologies potentially threaten to replace journalists.<br></p><p><br><strong>C. W.

Living among them, he observed for the first time a sight that would inspire the rest of his life: the millennia-old migration of the Arctic's caribou in their teeming multitudes. With the Ihalmiut, Mowat also endured bleak winters, suffered agonizing shortages of food, and witnessed the continual, devastating intrusions of interlopers bent on exploitation. Here, in the first book to exhibit the prodigious literary talent that would produce some of the most memorable books of the next half-century, Mowat chronicles his harrowing experiences. <br><br><i>People of the Deer</i> is the lyrical portrait of a beautiful and endangered society, and a mournful reproach to those who would manipulate and destroy indigenous cultures anywhere in the world. Most of all, it is a tribute to the last People of the Deer, the Ihalmiut, whose calamitous encounter with modern civilization resulted in their tragic decline.</p><p>"A beautifully written book...Mowat's challenge cannot be ignored."<br>-<i>Saturday Night</i>THEY WERE IN HARMONY WITH THE LAND BUT THEY WERE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION<br>Sixty years ago, the Ihalmiut numbered 7,000. When Farely Mowat visited them, their population had dwindled to forty. For two years, Mowat shared their hard life--the bleak winters, the shortages of food, the fervent struggle to withstand the intrusion of white men--and came to understand them. Here, Farely Mowat indicts those who have abused the Ihalmiut. But, foremost, he pays tribute to the last of the People of the Deer--the proud, valiant Eskimos, desperately trying to survive.</p><h2>God&#39;s Samurai: Lead Pilot at Pearl Harbor (The Warriors)</h2><p><i>God's Samurai</i> is the unusual story of Mitsuo Fuchida, the career aviator who led the attack on Pearl Harbor and participated in most of the fiercest battles of the Pacific war.

Our increasingly fast-paced world seems more and more remote from the world narrated in Scripture. But despite its pervasiveness, there remains a dearth of theological reflection about computer technology and what it means to live as a faithful Christian in a digitally-saturated society. In this thoughtful and timely book, Derek Schuurman provides a brief theology of technology, rooted in the Reformed tradition and oriented around the grand themes of creation, fall, redemption and new creation. He combines a concise, accessible style with penetrating cultural and theological analysis. Building on the work of Jacques Ellul, Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, and drawing from a wide range of Reformed thinkers, Schuurman situates computer technology within the big picture of the biblical story. Technology is not neutral, but neither is there an exclusively &#34;Christian&#34; form of technological production and use. Instead, Schuurman guides us to see the digital world as part of God?s good creation, fallen yet redeemable according to the law of God. Responsibly used, technology can become an integral part of God?s shalom for the earth.</p><p><strong>Derek C. Schuurman</strong> (Ph.D., McMaster University) is associate professor of computer science and chair of the mathematics/physics/computer science department at Redeemer University College, Ancaster, Ontario. Coauthor of <em>PSpice Simulation of Power Electronics Circuits</em> (with R. S. Ramshaw, 1997), Schuurman is also an active researcher and speaker in the areas of robotics and computer vision as well as faith and technology issues."Read <em>Shaping a Digital World</em> and be reminded that all culture, even our computer culture fits within God's sovereign control and fits within our narrative of creation, fall, redemption and restoration." (Dave Sikkema, Christian Renewal, April 16, 2014)<br><br>"Admitting that technology is a human cultural activity that is 'value laden,' Schuurman does not juxtapose technology and theology oppositionally, but instead offers an optimistic vision of how belief imbues technology with greater purpose; he also takes time to critique humanity's negative use of technology and discusses some of technology's potential pitfalls. . . . the book is succinct enough to keep even the non-technical reader engaged." (Publishers Weekly, April 8, 2013)<br><br>"'What does Silicon Valley have to do with Jerusalem?' With that play on Tertullian's ancient remark about Athens and Jerusalem, Derek Schuurman begins his discussion of the relationship between Christian faith and computer technology. It turns out that the answer is 'quite a lot.' The book presents a broad but thorough overview of issues a Christian in the computer field ought to consider. . . . [T]his is a well-written book that fills an important gap. I know of no other book that is like it." (Russel C. Bjork, Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, March 2014)<br><br>"In the end, <em>Shaping a Digital World</em> provides a useful introduction to how the technology of a digital age relates to Christian morality. Schuurman provides a helpful outline for framing this discussion through the grand redemptive-historical themes of creation, fall, redemption and new creation. . . . Shaping a Digital World makes strides in understanding how technology, as one part of God?s good creation, can be leveraged to the praise and glory of God." (Peter M. Anderson, Themelios, 38.3)<br><br>"<em>Shaping a Digital World</em> is recommended enthusiastically for any thinking person, but it is especially important for those who work in and teach about technology. . . . Given its many virtues, I will be using this gem as a required text the next time I teach Christian Ethics and Modern Culture at Denver Seminary." (Douglas Groothuis, Denver Seminary Journal, October 2013)<br><br>"<em>Shaping a Digital World</em> is ideal as a textbook for computer science courses, but it should also appeal to science and technology readers from any Christian tradition." (Burton K. Janes, Faith Today, May / June 2013)<br><br>"Schuurman's book is a rare jewel: rare because it is unusual to find genuinely helpful and insightful material on a Christian approach to computer science, a jewel because the author combines impeccable credentials as an engineer with wide reading in history, theology and philosophy to produce a readable and insightful treatment of the topic. I recommend it highly." (Al Wolters, Redeemer University College)<br><br>"Reflecting a deep understanding of both computer technology and of biblical truths, Derek Schuurman draws parallels between the two that enlighten our understanding and deepen our faith. He shows how a field as technical as computer science can be relevant to spirituality, encouraging every one of us to connect our vocation with our faith. Anyone dabbling in technology and interested in scriptural teaching would benefit from his insights." (Randy Isaac, executive director of the American Scientific Affiliation)<br><br>"What does it mean to be a Christian in today's high-tech world? This one-of-a-kind book deftly mixes computing technologies and biblical wisdom with the thoughts of people like Fred Brooks, Jacques Ellul, Donald Knuth, Marshall McLuhan, Plato, Neil Postman, Eric Raymond, Linus Torvalds and Sherry Turkle. The result is a heady brew exploring the implications of Christianity for our digital lives. Engagingly written, this book is a must-read for high-tech Christians interested in the question of how their faith and their technology relate to one another." (Joel Adams, professor of computer science, Calvin College)<br><br>"The little machines we now hold in our hands are not neutral. We make them, but they mold us. This book is an invitation to first recognize this and then think through its implications. Neither reactionary dismissal nor uncritical embrace, Schuurman roots technology in a biblical theology of culture, demonstrating that the Reformational tradition has gifts to offer the wider church. A fresh resource for Christian reflection on both computer science and our everyday digital lives." (James K. A. Smith, Gary Henrietta Byker Professor of Applied Reformed Theology and Worldview, Calvin College)</p><h2>One Pot Keto: Sheet Pan, Skillet, Baking Dish and Dutch Oven Recipes</h2><p>Keto cooking is easier than ever with <b>more than 75 keto-friendly recipes</b> all made on a <b>sheet pan</b>,&nbsp;in a <b>skillet</b>, <b>baking dish</b>, <b>slow cooker</b> or <b>Dutch oven</b>.<ul><li>Recipes&nbsp;for Chinese Peppercorn Beef, Pork Chops Bolognese, Roasted Rosemary Chicken Legs,&nbsp;Bacon &amp; Cheese Dip and more!</li><li>Every recipe is accompanied by a color photo</li><li>Chapters include: Breakfast; Soups &amp; Stews; Meat; Poultry; Fish &amp; Seafood; and Sides &amp; Dips</li><li>Hardcover</li><li>192 pages&nbsp;</li></ul>You'll <b>save time on prep and clean-up</b>, leaving more time to enjoy your fabulous keto meals!</p><p>Keto cooking is easier than ever with more than 75 keto-friendly recipes all made on a sheet pan or in a skillet, baking dish, slow cooker or Dutch oven.

Next to the filling station was a mechanic&#x2019;s shed whose desiccated boards lay collapsed upon a rusted pickup truck with four flat bald tires. At the intersection a stoplight hung from a horizontal cable strung between two power poles, its plastic covers shot out by .22 rifles.<br> <br>The young man entered a phone booth and wiped his face slick with the flat of his hand. His denim shirt was stiff with salt and open on his chest, his hair mowed into the scalp, GI-style. He pulled an unlabeled pint bottle from the front of his jeans and unscrewed the cap. Down the right side of his face was a swollen pink scar that was as bright and shiny as plastic and looked pasted onto the skin rather than part of it. The mescal in the bottle was yellow and thick with threadworms that seemed to light against the sunset when he tipped the neck to his mouth. Inside the booth, he could feel his heart quickening and lines of sweat running down from his armpits into the waistband of his undershorts. His index finger trembled as he punched in the numbers on the phone&#x2019;s console.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your emergency?&#x201d; a woman dispatcher asked.<br> <br>The rolling countryside was the color of a browned biscuit, stretching away endlessly, the monotony of rocks and creosote brush and grit and mesquite trees interrupted only by an occasional windmill rattling in the breeze.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last night there was some shooting here.

I think that&#x2019;s what happened. I was drinking. I saw it from down the road. It scared the doo-doo out of me.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a pause. &#x201c;Are you drinking now, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really. I mean, not much. Just a few hits of Mexican worm juice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell us where you are, and we&#x2019;ll send out a cruiser.

Across the street from the abandoned filling station, a tall man in his seventies, wearing western-cut khakis and hand-tooled boots and an old-fashioned gun belt and a dove-colored Stetson, parked his truck in front of what appeared to be the shell of a Spanish mission. The roof had caved onto the floor, and the doors had been twisted off the hinges and carried inside and broken up and used for firewood by homeless people or teenage vandals. The only tree in the crossroads community was a giant willow; it shaded one side of the church and created a strange effect of shadow and red light on the stucco walls, as though a grass fire were approaching the structure and about to consume it.<br> <br>In reality, the church had been built not by Spaniards or Mexicans but by an industrialist who had become the most hated man in America after his company security forces and members of the Colorado militia massacred eleven children and two women during a miners&#x2019; strike in 1914. Later, the industrialist reinvented himself as a philanthropist and humanitarian and rehabilitated his family name by building churches around the country. But the miners did not get their union, and this particular church became a scorched cipher that few associate with the two women and eleven children who had tried to hide in a root cellar while the canvas tent above them rained ash and flame upon their heads.<br> <br>The tall man was wearing a holstered blue-black white-handled revolver. Unconsciously, he removed his hat when he entered the church, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the deep shadows inside the walls. The oak flooring had been ripped up and hauled away by a contractor, and the dirt underneath was green and cool with lack of sunlight, packed down hard, humped in places, smelling of dampness and the feces of field mice. Scattered about the church&#x2019;s interior, glinting like gold teeth, were dozens of brass shell casings.<br> <br>The tall man squatted down, his gunbelt creaking, his knees popping. He picked up a casing on the end of a ballpoint pen. It, like all the others, was .45-caliber. He cleared his throat softly and spat to one side, unable to avoid the odor that the wind had just kicked up outside. He rose to his feet and walked out the back door and gazed at a field that had been raked by a bulldozer&#x2019;s blade, the cinnamon-colored dirt scrolled and stenciled by the dozer&#x2019;s steel treads.<br> <br>The tall man returned to his pickup truck and removed a leaf rake and a long-handled shovel from the bed. He walked into the field and sank the steel tip of the shovel blade with the weight of his leg and haunch and struck a rock, then reset the blade in a different spot and tried again. This time the blade went deep, all the way up to his boot sole, as though it were cutting through compacted coffee grounds rather than dirt. When he pulled the shovel free, an odor rose into his nostrils that made his throat close against the bilious surge in his stomach. He soaked a bandana from a canteen in his truck and wrapped it around the lower half of his face and knotted it behind his head. Then he walked slowly across the field, jabbing the inverted half of the rake handle into the ground. Every three or four feet, at the same depth, he felt a soft form of resistance, like a sack of feed whose burlap has rotted and split, the dry dirt rilling back into the hole each time he pulled the wood shaft from the surface. The breeze had died completely. The air was green with the sun&#x2019;s last light, the sky dissected by birds, the air stained by a growing stench that seemed to rise from his boots into his clothes. The tall man inverted the rake, careful not to touch the tip that he had pushed below the soil, and began scraping at a depression that a feral animal had already crosshatched with claw marks.<br> <br>The tall man had many memories from his early life that he seldom shared with others. They involved images of snowy hills south of the Yalu River, and dead Chinese troops in quilted uniforms scattered randomly across the slopes, and F-80 jets flying low out of the overcast sky, strafing the perimeter to push the Chinese mortar and automatic weapons teams back out of range. The wounds on the American dead piled in the backs of the six-bys looked like roses frozen inside snow.<br> <br>In his sleep, the tall man still heard bugles blowing in the hills, echoing as coldly as brass ringing on stone.<br> <br>The spidery tines of the rake pulled a lock of black hair free from the dirt. The tall man, whose name was Hackberry Holland, looked down into the depression. He touched the rake at the edges of the rounded shape he had uncovered. Then, because of either a lack of compaction around the figure or the fact that it lay on top of other bodies, the soil began to slide off the person&#x2019;s face and ears and neck and shoulders, down into a subterranean hole, exposing the waxy opalescence of a brow, the rictus that imitated surprise, one eye lidded, the other as bold as a child&#x2019;s marble, a ball of dirt clenched in the figure&#x2019;s palm.<br> <br>She was thin-boned, a toy person, her black blouse a receptacle for heat and totally inappropriate for the climate. He guessed she was not over seventeen and that she had been alive when the dirt was pushed on top of her. She was also Asian, not Hispanic as he had expected.<br> <br>For the next half hour, until the light had gone from the sky, he continued to rake and dig in the field that had obviously been scraped down to the hardpan by a dozer blade, then backfilled with the overburden and tamped down and graded as smoothly as if in preparation for construction of a home.<br> <br>He went back to his truck and threw the rake and shovel in the bed, then lifted his handheld radio off the passenger seat. &#x201c;Maydeen, this is Sheriff Holland,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m behind the old church at Chapala Crossing. I&#x2019;ve uncovered the burials of nine homicide victims so far, all female. Call the feds and also call both Brewster and Terrell counties and tell them we need their assistance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re breaking up. Say again? Did I read you right? You said nine homicide&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a mass murder. The victims are all Asian, some of them hardly more than children.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The guy who made the nine-one-one, he called a second time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d he say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he just happened by the church site. I think he&#x2019;s dripping with guilt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you get his name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He said it was Pete. No last name. Why didn&#x2019;t you call in? I could have sent help. You&#x2019;re too goddamn old for this crap, Hack.&#x201d;<br> <br>Because at a certain age, you finally accept and trust yourself and let go of the world, he thought. But in reply, all he said was &#x201c;Maydeen, would you not use that kind of language over the air, please?&#x201d;<br> <br><br>PETE FLORES NEVER quite understood why the girl lived with him. Her hair was chestnut-colored, cut short and curled on the ends, her skin clear, her blue-green eyes deep-set, which gave them a mysterious quality that intrigued men and caused them to stare at her back long after she had walked past them. At the diner where she worked, she conducted herself with a level of grace that her customers, mostly long-haul truckers, sensed and respected and were protective of. She attended classes three nights a week at a junior college in the county seat, and the previous semester had published a short story in the college literary magazine. Her name was Vikki Gaddis, and she played a big-belly J-200 Gibson that her father, a part-time country musician from Medicine Lodge, Kansas, had given her when she was twelve years old.<br> <br>Her husky voice and accent were not acquired or feigned. On occasion, when she played her guitar and sang at the diner, her customers rose from their chairs and stools and applauded. She also performed sometimes at the nightclub next door, although the patrons were unsure how they should respond when she sang &#x201c;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&#x201d; and &#x201c;Keep on the Sunny Side of Life.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was still asleep when Pete entered the paintless frame house they rented, one that sat inside the blue shadow of a hill when the sun rose above the horizon as hot and sultry as a broken egg yolk, the light streaking across the barren land. Pete&#x2019;s scalp and face were pulled tight with the beginnings of a hangover, the inside of his head still filled with the sounds of the highway bar he had been in. He washed his face in the sink, the water running cool out of a faucet that drew on an aluminum cistern elevated on stilts behind the house. The hill that blocked the sunrise, almost like an act of mercy, looked made of rust and cinders and was dotted with scrub brush and mesquite trees whose root systems could barely grow deep enough to find moisture. He knew Vikki would be up soon, that she had probably waited for him last night and slept fitfully, either knowing or not knowing where he was. He wanted to fix breakfast for her, as a form of contrition or in a pretense at normalcy. He filled the coffeepot with water, and the effect of both darkness and coolness it created inside the metal was somehow a temporary balm to the pounding heat inside his head.<br> <br>He smeared margarine inside a skillet and took two eggs and a piece of sliced ham from the ice chest he and Vikki used as a refrigerator. He broke the eggs in the skillet and set the ham and a slice of sourdough bread beside them and let the skillet begin to heat on the propane stove. The smell of the breakfast he wanted to cook for Vikki rose into his face, and he rushed out the back door into the yard so he would not retch on his clothes.<br> <br>He held on to the sides of a horse tank, his stomach empty now, his back shaking, a pressure band tightening across his scalp, his breath an insult to the air and the freshness of the morning. He thought he heard the thropping downdraft of gunships and the great clanking weight of an armored vehicle topping a rise, its treads dripping sand, a CD of Burn, Motherfucker, Burn screaming over the intercom. He stared into the distant wastes, but the only living things he saw were carrion birds floating high on the wind stream, turning in slow circles as the land heated and the smell of mortality rose into the sky.<br> <br>He went back inside and rinsed his mouth, then scraped Vikki&#x2019;s breakfast onto a plate. The eggs were burned on the edges, the yolks broken and hard and stained with black grease. He sat in a chair and hung his head between his knees, the kitchen spinning around him. Through the partially opened door of the bedroom, through the blue light and the dust stirring in the breeze, he could see her head on the pillow, her eyes closed, her lips parted with her breathing. The poverty of the surroundings into which he had taken her made him ashamed. The cracks in the linoleum were ingrained with dirt, the mismatched furniture bought at Goodwill, the walls a sickly green. Everything he touched except Vikki Gaddis was somehow an extension of his own failure.<br> <br>Her eyes opened. Pete sat up straight in the chair, trying to smile, his face stiff and unnatural with the effort.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was fixing you breakfast, but I made a mess of it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where you been, hon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, up yonder,&#x201d; he replied, gesturing in the direction of the highway. He waited for her to speak, but she didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Why would people throw away their tennis shoes but take the shoestrings with them?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the places where the wets go through, there&#x2019;s trash and garbage everywhere. They throw away their old tennis shoes, but they take out the strings first. Why do they do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>She was standing up now, pulling her jeans over her panties, looking down at her fingers as she buttoned her jeans over the flatness of her stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s &#x2019;cause they don&#x2019;t own much else, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said in answer to his own question. &#x201c;Them poor people don&#x2019;t own nothing but the word of the coyote that takes them across. That&#x2019;s a miserable fate for someone, isn&#x2019;t ...</p><h2>A Tree in the House: Flowers for your Home, Special Occasions and Every Day</h2><p>Part guide for the aspiring home florist, part ode to rural interiors and buildings,&nbsp;A Tree in the House&nbsp;celebrates the art of arranging flowers for celebrations big, small and in-between held throughout the year.

He divides his time among Florida, New Hampshire, and Boston. His most recent novels include <i>Host</i>, <i>Cell</i>, and <i>Nano</i>.Robin Cook&#39;s thriller focuses on global corporate espionage in the field of medical research. Its most valuable asset is a cultured reading by George Guidall. Treating each character as an individual, he puts careful stress on single syllables, allowing his accents to vary and remain dignified while never descending into stereotype. Much of the book deals with the Yakuza (organized crime--Japanese style), and Guidall frequently delivers the narration in a rhythm that suggests Japanese intonation. His delivery of dialogue, regardless of nationality, is highly animated, and, fortunately, there&#39;s quite a lot of it. An overabundance of medical details often interferes with the story, so Guidall&#39;s voice brings welcome humanity to the numerous characters and credibility to the many action scenes.

Her fortieth high school reunion, the last one, is one week away, and she&#x2019;s trying to decide whether or not to draw a beauty mark above her lip for the occasion. It wouldn&#x2019;t be entirely false; she does have a mole there, but it&#x2019;s faint, hard to see. She just wants to enhance what already exists, nothing wrong with that; it&#x2019;s de rigueur if you&#x2019;re a woman, and it&#x2019;s becoming more common in men, too. Wrong as that is. Dorothy would never have anything to do with a man who wore makeup or dyed his hair or carried a purse or wore support hose or cried or did any of those womanly things men are appropriating as though it&#x2019;s their god-given right. No. She prefers an all-American, red-blooded male who is not a jerk. They&#x2019;re hard to find, but she holds out hope that she will have some sort of meaningful relationship with one before she&#x2019;s six feet under.<br><br>She regards herself in the mirror, tilts her head this way and that. Yes, a beauty mark would be fun, kind of playful. She pencils in the mark gingerly, then steps back to regard herself. Not bad. Not bad at all. Sexy. Just like she wanted. Helloooo, Marilyn. She pictures Pete Decker looking up from his table full of jocks when she walks into the hotel ballroom and saying, Va va va voom! And then, Dorothy? Dorothy Shauman?<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; she will say, lightly, musically, and walk right past him. Though she will walk close enough to him for him to smell her perfume. Also new. One hundred and ten smackeroos. She got perfume, not cologne, even though her personal belief is that there is no difference. She&#x2019;d asked the counter woman about that. She&#x2019;d leaned in confidentially and said, &#x201c;Now, come on. Tell me, really. If you were my best friend, would you tell me to get the perfume over the cologne?&#x201d; And the woman had looked her right in the eye and said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Dorothy was a little miffed, because the woman had acted as though Dorothy had affronted her dignity or questioned her ethics or something. Like the time Dr. Strickland was telling Dorothy to get a certain ($418!!!) blood test and she&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Would you tell your wife to get it?&#x201d; And Dr. Strickland had drawn himself up and quietly said, &#x201c;I would.&#x201d; Dorothy had been all set to give him an affectionate little punch and say, &#x201c;Oh, come on, now; don&#x2019;t be so prissy,&#x201d; but then Dr. Strickland had added, &#x201c;If she were still alive,&#x201d; and that had just ruined everything. It wasn&#x2019;t her fault the woman had died! Dorothy had been going to refuse the test no matter what, but when he said his wife was dead, well, then she had to get it. Those dead people had more power than they thought.<br><br>Dorothy has never gone to a high school reunion. She&#x2019;d been married when they had them before, and who wanted to bring that to a reunion. Now she is divorced, plus she saw that movie about saying yes to life. She steps closer to the mirror and raises her chin so her turkey neck disappears. She&#x2019;ll hold her head like this when she walks by Pete Decker. Later, when they&#x2019;re making out in his car, it will be dark, and she won&#x2019;t have to be so vigilant. Oh, she hopes he drives to the reunion; she happens to know he lives a mere three and a half hours away. She knows his exact address, in fact; and she Google-Earthed him, which was very exciting.<br><br>In high school, Pete had a four-on-the-floor, metallic green GTO, and Dorothy always wanted to make out with him in that car. But she never even got to sit in it. She bets he has something like a red Lexus coupe now. And she bets that at the reunion he&#x2019;ll watch her for a while, then come up to her and say, &#x201c;Hey, Dots. Want to take a walk?&#x201d; And she&#x2019;ll say, all innocent, &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; And he&#x2019;ll get a little flustered and say something like &#x201c;You know, just a walk, get some air.&#x201d; She&#x2019;ll hesitate just for a second, just long enough to make him think she might refuse, and then she&#x2019;ll shrug prettily before she agrees to accompany him outside. They&#x2019;ll go right to his car and he&#x2019;ll open the passenger-side door and raise an eyebrow and she&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;Pete!&#x201d; like she&#x2019;s offended at the very notion. But then she&#x2019;ll get in, will she ever. She likes this part of the fantasy best: She&#x2019;ll get in, he&#x2019;ll come around and get in on his side, and then, just before he lunges at her, he&#x2019;ll look at her with smoke practically coming out of his eyes. And in her eyes, a soft Yes, I know. I, too, have wanted this for years.<br><br>Dorothy does plan on being a little mean to Pete at first; she has finally learned it can be a good thing to be mean to men. Apparently they like it; it&#x2019;s supposed to appeal to their hunting instinct. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s going to walk right by him when he first sees her and notices how attractive she is. Considering.<br><br>Her daughter, Hilly, is the one who told her about being mean to men. She said you do it just at the beginning and then every so often, just to keep up a level of intrigue, like immunization shots. And it works, too, because when Hilly started doing it, wasn&#x2019;t she engaged in what seemed like ten minutes! She&#x2019;s getting married in Costa Rica next month, and Dorothy thinks it&#x2019;s a wonderful idea, the destination wedding. Thank God Dorothy&#x2019;s ex will pay for everything. Poor he was not. She supposes he&#x2019;ll bring his new wife to the wedding, and pander to her every single second. Holding her hand, as though they were teenagers. Bringing her drinks, as though the woman is incapable of doing anything for herself. Staring into her eyes like the secret of the universe is written there. It&#x2019;s nauseating, the way they behave, anyone would say so. Hilly calls them the Magnets, though she might only do that to offer some kind of support to her mother, who lives alone now and must take out the garbage and figure out whom to call for repairs and check the locks at night and kill centipedes in the basement and everything else. Dorothy suspects the truth is, Hilly actually likes her stepmother. She hasn&#x2019;t said so directly, but she did say that she&#x2019;s happy for her dad, and wasn&#x2019;t that just like nails on a chalkboard. But Dorothy did the noble thing and said yes, she was, too. Uh-huh, yes, he did seem happy now, Dorothy said, and she just wanted to throw up.<br><br>Hilly&#x2019;s fianc� is a doctor. A proctologist, specializing in the wonderful world of buttholes and rectums, but still. Dorothy is working up to asking the question that&#x2014;come on!&#x2014;must occur to everyone to ask him: What exactly made you choose this line of work? When Dorothy tried to ask her daughter about it, all Hilly did was get mad. It is true Dorothy could have used a more sensitive approach&#x2014;what she&#x2019;d asked Hilly was &#x201c;Why in the wide, wide world would you ever want to look up people&#x2019;s heinies all day?&#x201d; Still, Dorothy doesn&#x2019;t see why Hilly had to take such offense. Her daughter had said something like perhaps Dorothy should consider the fact that preventing and treating cancer is a pretty noble goal. But that still didn&#x2019;t answer the question, did it?<br><br>Dorothy thinks it was a book her daughter read that taught her about being mean to men. Who knows, if Dorothy had been mean to Pete Decker in high school, they might have gotten married. They went out once&#x2014;well, not a date technically, but they did spend some time together on the class trip to Washington, D.C., and Dorothy was awfully nice to Pete and then of course that was that, he never called her. But if they had gotten married, they probably would have gotten divorced, and then she wouldn&#x2019;t be looking forward so much to going to her high school reunion. Apart from her friends Linda Studemann and Judy Holt, she&#x2019;s really only going to see him. And, to be honest, to show off her recent weight loss. That was the one nice thing about her divorce: During the grief part, before she realized how much better off she was without her husband, she lost twenty-three pounds. She bets she&#x2019;ll look better than the cheerleaders, and even better than Candy Sullivan, who had been queen of everything. Not that Candy Sullivan is coming. According to Pam Pottsman, who is the contact person for this year&#x2019;s reunion, Candy came to the five-year reunion and hasn&#x2019;t come to any since. &#x201c;Is she dead?&#x201d; Dorothy asked, ready to offer an impromptu eulogy praising Candy&#x2019;s good points, even though Candy never gave Dorothy the time of day. But Pam said no, Candy wasn&#x2019;t dead, apparently she just thought she was too good to come, and then they both started talking about what a snob Candy always was, and she wasn&#x2019;t even really all that hot. &#x201c;Did you know she stuffed her bra?&#x201d; Pam said, and Dorothy said, &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; and felt that delicious rush, and Pam said, &#x201c;Yup, I sat across from her in Mr. Simon&#x2019;s psychology class and I saw Kleenex coming out of the top of her blouse one day and I whispered to her that it was showing and she got all embarrassed and stuffed it back in and wouldn&#x2019;t look at me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But wait a minute,&#x201d; Dorothy said. &#x201c;I saw her naked in gym class, and she didn&#x2019;t need any Kleenex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What year?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Senior. And she did not need Kleenex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that psychology class was sophomore year,&#x201d; Pam said, and she sounded a little disappointed that Candy Sullivan had outgrown her need for bra stuffing. But then she told Dorothy how a lot more people were coming this year than ever before, probably because it was the last reunion their class was going to have; and she named several of their classmates who had signed up. Dorothy thinks it will be fun to see poor Mary Alice Mayhew, who is coming for her very first reunion, just as Dorothy is. Though there the similarity ends, thank you very much. Such a little mouse Mary Alice was, walking down the hall and looking at the floor, all hunched over her schoolbooks. She wore awful plaid dresses, and she never wore nylons, just thin white ankle socks, not even kneesocks. And loafers that were not Weejuns, you could tell. From a mile away, you could tell. Poor thing. And wait, didn&#x2019;t she put pennies in them? There&#x2019;s always one of them, and in their school, it was Mary Alice Mayhew.<br><br>Oh, and Lester Hessenpfeffer, who was screwed the moment he was christened. Lester&#x2019;s uncle, who was present at his birth, had just changed his own last name to Hess, and he suggested that Lester&#x2019;s father do the same for the sake of his newborn son. Lester&#x2019;s father reportedly screamed, &#x201c;Change our name! Change our name? Why should we change our name? Let the rest of the world change their names!&#x201d; Lester had told that story once when someone teased him about his name. You had to give Lester this: he was always an affable guy who didn&#x2019;t ever seem to take things personally.<br><br>Poor Lester. Never dated. He had such a cute face, but he was too much of a brain, and too sensitive. He probably ended up in computers. Maybe he got rich, like that homely Microsoft guy. And if so, you can bet your boots that Dorothy will be saying hello to him, too.<br><br>If Mary Alice Mayhew really comes to the reunion, Dorothy will make a point of being nice to her. Yes she will. She&#x2019;ll buy her a drink; oh, what a hoot to think of buying Mary Alice Mayhew a drink. So odd to think that they&#x2019;re old enough to drink now. Mary Alice had silver cat-eye glasses with rhinestones on them and her hair always looked like she&#x2019;d taken the rollers out and not brushed it. Dorothy has heard plenty of stories about how ugly ducklings come to their high school reunions as swans, but she&#x2019;d bet money that Mary Alice looks much the same, only with wrinkles. She wouldn&#x2019;t be the Botox type. Dorothy&#x2019;s position on Botox is Thank God. Who cares if you can&#x2019;t move your eyebrows around like caterpillars on a plate?<br><br>&#x201c;Is Pete Decker coming?&#x201d; Dorothy asked Pam.<br><br>&#x201c;He is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And his wife, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He only registered himself. You know Pete. Oh, I can hardly wait to see him again. What a dreamboat he was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, did you think so?&#x201d; Dorothy studied her nails casually, as though she and Pam were talking in person. If you wanted to sound a certain way, even on the telephone, it was good to act a certain way&#x2014;the feeling crept into your voice. You were supposed to smile when you were talking on the phone if you wanted to sound friendly. A lot of the people who made recordings for telephone prompts seemed to do that, though such recordings always make Dorothy want to bang the phone against the wall until the wires fall out.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought Pete Decker was the most handsome boy in the school!&#x201d; Pam said. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I guess a lot of people found him attractive.&#x201d; Dorothy sniffed then, and changed the subject. No need for Pam to know of Dorothy&#x2019;s designs on Pete; Pam was quicker than Twitter at spreading things around.<br><br>Dorothy turns and views herself from the side: not bad. The bra, bought yesterday on her final stop for putting together a killer outfit, is doing what it promised; her breasts are hiked up and perky, rather than hanging down so low they appear to be engaging in conversation with her belly button. Eighty-five dollars for a bra! At least it&#x2019;s French. Dorothy always likes it when things are French. In the dressing room, she&#x2019;d sniffed the bra to see if it smelled like Chanel or something, but no, it smelled like rubber. Not for long. Dorothy will have everything perfumed when she goes to that reunion, even her you-know-what. But she&#x2019;ll have to remember to pat it on down there; last time she sprayed, she gave herself a urinary tract infection and, oh, does she hate cranberry juice.<br>She steps back from the mirror, then leans in to darken the beauty mark. Perfect. She should take a picture of herself to remember to do it just like this on Saturday night. They&#x2019;re having a Saturday night dinner followed by a dance, complete with a DJ who&#x2019;s supposed to be really good and not tacky, and then there&#x2019;s a Sunday brunch. Two times for a final try at glory.<br><br>Dorothy&#x2019;s stomach growls, and she puts her hand over it and says aloud, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><h2>Yoga for Transformation: Ancient Teachings and Practices for Healing the Body, Mind,and Heart (Compass)</h2><p><b>Go beyond the physical exercise of yoga with the founder of the American Viniyoga Institute</b><br><br>While there is no denying yoga's popularity as a form of physical exercise, the other life-enhancing aspects of this tradition remain obscure to many Westerners. In <b>Yoga for Transformation</b>, <b>Gary Kraftsow</b> introduces techniques that treat not only the physical body but also the emotions, mind, heart, and soul of the practitioner-the places where real transformation can take place. There are breathing techniques to control energy levels, exercises to train and sharpen the intellect, and meditative practices to help increase self-awareness. With more than 350 black and white photographs throughout, this unique and accessible book is dedicated to strengthening the whole self-body, mind, and spirit.</p><p>Yoga has millions of devotees in the Western world, but most contemporary yoga students center their practice on postures but not on the ancient teachings that are still relevant today. In <i>Yoga for Transformation</i>, author Gary Kraftsow leads the modern yoga student in combining posture practice with the rich and deep tradition of mind, heart, and spirit. He presents core postures (asanas), clearly illustrated by models of all ages, and describes how to incorporate breathing, chanting, meditation, prayer, and ritual to add a spiritual dimension to your practice. <p> "The purpose of these practices is to serve you in deepening your self-understanding, and to assist you in the process of self-transformation," writes Kraftsow, founder of the American Viniyoga institute and author of <i>Yoga for Wellness: Healing with the Timeless Teachings of Viniyoga</i>. Viniyoga is a methodology for developing a personal yoga practice using asana, pranayama (breathing), meditation, ritual, and prayer.

She has been the only one who has guided me to an understanding of how these two aspects, physical and spiritual, interpenetrate and are one and the same. She then gives a map to explore this as a real practical experience, not just philosophy. Because the path to her understanding was entirely experiential, she has been outside any spiritual system, which showed me how the spiritual is inherent in nature, not something born of Eastern or Western spiritual or religious traditions. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This knowledge almost immediately switched my inquiry away from looking for the &#x2018;spiritual&#x2019; or being on a path, to having an appreciation and direct experience of the vast beauty that I am composed of, and the incredible intelligence that is the foundation of my being. I have been able to relax and trust the process of awakening for the first time, not as something to figure out, but as something to rest in and savor.

Kaparo deserves recognition as a pioneer; she is the only person of whom I am personally aware who has formed her ideas through both&nbsp;her personally developed rehabilitation and&nbsp;subsequently applied and validated clinical experience in transformational healing. Her system is unique.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Stan Friedman, PhD, clinical psychologist in private practice, Los Angeles, California<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In her excellent book, Risa Kaparo shares with readers her process of &#x2018;learning to navigate the ocean of life&#x2019; through a series of&nbsp;contemplative exercises that allow the reader&#x2019;s mind-body experience to release and awaken to the freedom that is our true nature. This is one of the most comprehensive presentations available of learning how to be in the active experience of moment-to-moment &#x2018;presencing,&#x2019; getting in touch with the subtleties of one&#x2019;s own physical, non-dual integration with life itself.

She embodies a challenge&#x2014;to transform our minds and become like her, whose tranquility, compassion, and wisdom make her so beautiful&#x2014;but one that is profoundly nurturing. In the author's words, "We can relax in her presence and look at ourselves honestly, knowing that Tara will not judge, reject, or abandon us due to our shortcomings. Like a mother, she sees her child's potential&#x2014;in this case, our spiritual potential or Buddha-nature&#x2014;and wants to nurture it." Ven. Chodron describes a simple meditation on Tara, explaining its benefits and its application to daily life. She then presents two well-loved praises to Tara, together with reflections on their meanings for modern practitioners. Included here are the "Homage to the Twenty-one Taras," verses that are frequently chanted in Tibetan monasteries and homes, and "A Song of Longing for Tara, the Infallible," by Lama Lobsang Tenpey Gyaltsen.</p><p>The beloved deity Tara is the feminine embodiment of enlightenment.

But as a powerful hurricane bears down on the island, turmoil swirls inside the villa, forcing each of the women to reevaluate everything she knows about her friends&#x2014;and herself.</p><p><p><b>Guest Review of &#x201c;Best of Us&#x201d; </b></p><p></p><p><b>By Jennifer Weiner</b></p><p></p> <p>Old college friends, reuniting to celebrate a birthday of the geeky guy down the hall who&#x2019;s now a billionaire. A gorgeous villa in a tropical paradise. A weekend getaway where the private jet whisks you off to the private beach, and a private chef prepares gourmet feasts. Add a trunk-load of secrets, old resentments, clandestine kisses &#x2013; not to mention enough booze to float a cruise ship &#x2013; and you&#x2019;ve got the ingredients for a beach read with humor and heart.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, Tina, Allie and Savannah were friends at the University of Virginia, and Dwight Glass, &#x201c;thin and awkward as a praying mantis,&#x201d; was their brainy, socially awkward friend.</p> <p>Now Dwight&#x2019;s made a fortune from the dot-com he founded, is married to pretty Pauline, who does volunteer work and has turned trying to get pregnant into a full-time job. Tina Antonelli is a stay-at-home mom, happily married, if a little overwhelmed by the mechanics of managing four children: &#x201c;the enormous jumble of dirty laundry on the basement floor, the egg-encrusted dishes littering the kitchen sink, the new stain on the rug, which already resembled a Rorschach test.&#x201d; Allie Reed, Tina&#x2019;s best friend from college, a girl who read to the blind, &#x201c;loaned out her class notes to anyone who asked...smiled at everyone she passed on the street,&#x201d; and dragged Dwight into some semblance of a social life, is a social worker. She works part-time, enjoys her two daughters...and if she and her architect husband &#x201c;had sex a bit less often these days, if all of their activities seemed to revolve around the girls &#x2013; well, wasn&#x2019;t that to be expected when you had young kids?&#x201d;</p> <p>Savannah McGrivey, a glamorous real-estate agent with a gym-toned body and a flashy wardrobe, has it all &#x2013; except for a husband. After putting Gary through medical school, he&#x2019;s dumped her for a nurse. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d been so proud when he could officially add the initials M.D. after his name, feeling as though it was their shared triumph. How ironic that an anesthesiologist had caused her the most pain she&#x2019;d ever felt in her entire life.&#x201d; When an Internet date goes disastrously bad, Savannah decides to join her friends and their spouses in Jamaica, without telling them that Gary&#x2019;s jumped ship. </p> <p>These women might have been cardboard-thin clich�s &#x2013; the burdened mother, the good girl, the cougar, the trophy wife. But with Pekkanen&#x2019;s sharp eye for detail, and her generosity toward her flawed-but-trying cast of characters, the ladies of <i>The Best of Us</i> emerge as full-bodied and believable, with more dimensions than you&#x2019;d expect. Pauline&#x2019;s arc, in particular, is surprising and heartbreaking, as Pekkanen peels back the layers to show why social-climbing Pauline is so obsessed with security, financial and otherwise, and to show us the depths of Dwight&#x2019;s love. The dialogue will ring true to any reader who&#x2019;s ever wondered about the road not taken, or found herself in the breakdown lane of the road she did take. &#x201c;Want to know the first thought that pops into my mind almost every morning after opening my eyes?&#x201d; Tina asks. &#x201c;I start anticipating being able to go to bed at night. I&#x2019;m just so tired all the time.</p> <p>You won&#x2019;t always like the women &#x2013; Tina can be a martyr, Savannah can be a handful, and Pauline&#x2019;s high-handed tone with her staff will grate on anyone who&#x2019;s ever toiled in the service sector &#x2013; but watching them reveal their true selves during a long weekend in Paradise is a wonderful escape, and a chance to vacation vicariously. You may not spend your spring break flying in a private jet, or get a chance to vacation with your BFFs in a posh villa that sits on a bluff overlooking a white-sand beach, enjoying jaunts on helicopters or a chartered catamaran (or, in Savannah&#x2019;s case, the attention of the catamaran&#x2019;s hunky first mate)...but <i>The Best of Us</i> is surely the next best thing.</p>Sarah Pekkanen&nbsp;is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Ever After</i>, <i>The Opposite of Me, Skipping a Beat, These Girls, The Best of Us, Catching Air, </i><i>Things You Won&#x2019;t Say</i>, and <i>The Perfect Neighbors</i>.

Two revolutionary genetic studies, published independently in Nature, 2015, showed that prehistoric Europe underwent two successive waves of migration, one from Anatolia consistent with the introduction of agriculture, and a later influx from the Pontic-Caspian steppes which without any reasonable doubt pinpoints the archaeological Yamnaya complex as the cradle of (Core-)Indo-European languages. Now, for the first time, when the preliminaries are clear, it is possible for the fields of genetics, archaeology and historical linguistics to cooperate in a constructive fashion to refine our knowledge of the Indo-European homeland, migrations, society and language. For the historical-comparative linguists, this opens up a wealth of exciting perspectives and new working fields in the intersections between linguistics and neighboring disciplines, for the archaeologists and geneticists, on the other hand, the linguistic contributions help to endow the material findings with a voice from the past. The present selection of papers illustrate the importance of an open interdisciplinary discussion which will gradually help us in our quest of Tracing the Indo-Europeans.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface/Introduction: Tracing the Indo-Europeans (by the editors)<br><br>The Indo-European homeland: Introducing the problem.

With new interviews, firsthand accounts, and archival material that has only recently been uncovered, this visually dramatic biography promises to introduce Mandela&#x2019;s gripping story to a whole new generation of readers.</p><p>Norton&#x2019;s previous collaboration with The Nelson Mandela Foundation, Nelson Mandela&#x2019;s Favorite African Folktales, won the NAACP Award in 2003. Nelson Mandela, who will be ninety-one on July 18, 2009, lives in Johannesburg.Like most graphic novels produced with educational intent, the art takes a far second to the didactic text in this graphic biography of the South African icon. It's tough to criticize a book created to contribute to the ongoing canonization of the still-living Mandela. The intent is clear from the lack of individual creator credits, since who actually wrote these words and drew these pictures isn't important to the Mandela Foundation; what matters is that this is an authorized, approved biography created in a format to attract the attention of younger people, those who might not have been alive during the decade when Free Nelson Mandela was a politically important chant. The likenesses are adequate in standard poses, but wildly varying when the artists are called upon to deviate from reference, with faces appearing deformed. Much of the art consists of boring talking heads. Mandela was born in 1918, and the book will be released on his 91st birthday. That's an achievement to be congratulated, but this dull history comic should be far down the gift list. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on his 30 years of teaching and service, <b>Bo Lozoff</b> shows why compassion--not success, self-improvement, or self-esteem--is at the root of happiness. In 26 intimate, inspiring chapters--each accompanied by a specific practice--Lozoff covers themes such as developing honesty, learning humility, dealing with anger, and honoring relationships. He shows how practices such as a daily vow of kindness or a simple commitment of time with others can have a profound effect on ourselves and our world. Lozoff's stories and lessons can awaken everyone to a happier and more fulfilled life.</p><p>Like many great teachers, it is not <i>what</i> he says that makes Bo Lozoff so inspiring, it is <i>how</i> he says it. Named one of the top 100 spiritual visionaries by the <i>Utne Reader</i>, Lozoff is a renowned lecturer and the cofounder of the Human Kindness Foundation, which sponsors the Prison-Ashram Project (originally started with Ram Dass). <p>Having spent 35 years studying interfaith teachings, Lozoff speaks with a humble authority, drawing upon the wisdom of Buddhism as effortlessly as he quotes Saint Paul or recounts stories from Judaism. As a seeker, he knows what it takes to sustain a spiritual practice, which is why half of his book is devoted to this crucial task. Although he offers practical advice, he never falters into a superficial "how to" voice. Rather, Lozoff uses a spiritually mature narrative to demonstrate how life can be a meaningful process, instead of "a climb to the top." Essays include a practice for facing fears, mantras for everyday life, and a prayer of humility.</p><p> Where the first half of the book addresses the "Inner Journey of Communion," the second emphasizes "The Outer Path Toward Community." Considering his life work, such as offering spiritual guidance to prisoners, it is not surprising that Lozoff gives equal time to living a life of service. Starting with understanding one's life calling, and moving through commitments to loved ones and the greater world, this section sings with intelligence, nudging us beyond practice and into a life worth living. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Bo Lozoff</b> is a spiritual activist and co-founder of the Human Kindness Foundation, which sponsors the Prison-Ashram Project (founded twenty-five years ago with <b>Ram Dass</b>), a quarterly newsletter, and Kindness House (a spiritual community that is open to visitors). He holds an honorary doctorate from the Chicago Theological Seminary. He has lectured in hundreds of prisons, universities, churches, and spiritual centers around the world and his work has been featured in many national publications.

Is he still spooky, unpredictable, inattentive, and pushy? Are you a new horse owner who wants to ensure that you give your horse the opportunity to reach his full potential? Or maybe you&#39;ve owned horses your whole life, but know there is still something missing or room for improvement. This book is for you. Tales of Horsemanship is a collection of short stories that give you a front row seat to witness successful and effective horse training as it happens. You will learn the secrets of what works, what doesn&#39;t, and why. Reading this book will give you the keys to communicate so clearly with your horse that he will willingly and easily do anything you ask. It will take you inside the mind of the horse and inside the mind of Carson James as he applies authentic horsemanship in many different scenarios to solve problems, unlock potential, and help improve the lives of both horses and horse owners. In each chapter Carson points out the problem, explains what&#39;s causing the problem, and then describes in detail how to fix it by dealing with the root of the problem. A lot of books like this just show you step 1, 2, 3 on how to fix horse problems. This book isn&#39;t like that. This book dives deep into the psychology of the horse&#39;s brain and paints a clear picture of why the problem is happening and how to fix it using natural methods. If your goals with your horse include building a lasting partnership and being a better, more confident leader, then don&#39;t leave the page without getting this book.</p><p>Carson James takes horsemanship back to its original and pure form. His experience working for large ranches in the northwest, for performance trainers, and riding thousands of &#39;problem&#39; horses around the country has given him the opportunity to practically apply the horsemanship skills he outlines in this book. His ability to break these concepts down into small and easily understandable steps sets him apart from many contemporary clinicians. He began his horsemanship journey as a teenager. He needed some cash in his pocket, so he started riding some local horses for folks just to keep them exercised. But he soon realized that his skills were lacking, and he was determined to find out what was really going on in the horse&#39;s mind. As his passion to become a skilled rider grew, he studied the great horsemen of the past, vaquero horsemanship, dressage, and anything else he could get his hands on. Then he worked for some performance trainers and surrounded himself with guys who were really handy horseback on some big ranches in the northwest. He rode horse after horse not only getting a job done but allowing each one to teach him something new. It was a lot of trial and error, but he found that no matter what level a horse is at, or what &#39;problems&#39; he is having, every single horse will respond when you apply true horsemanship. Now he make hundreds of horse training videos for his followers and travels around the country conducting clinics to impart to others what the horses have taught him.</p><h2>Rot &amp; Ruin (1)</h2><p>In the zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic America where Benny Imura lives, every teenager must find a job by the time they turn fifteen or get their rations cut in half. Benny doesn&#39;t want to apprentice as a zombie hunter with his boring older brother Tom, but he has no choice. He expects a tedious job whacking zoms for cash, but what he gets is a vocation that will teach him what it means to be human.</p><p>Jonathan Maberry is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, five-time Bram Stoker Award winner, and comic book writer.

He barely liked his family&#x2014;and by family he meant his older brother, Tom&#x2014;and he definitely didn&#x2019;t like the idea of &#x201c;business.&#x201d; Or work. The only part of the deal that sounded like it might be fun was the actual killing.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d never done it before. Sure, he&#x2019;d gone through a hundred simulations in gym class and in the Scouts, but they never let kids do any real killing. Not before they hit fifteen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he asked his Scoutmaster, a fat guy named Feeney who used to be a TV weatherman back in the day. Benny was eleven at the time and obsessed with zombie hunting. &#x201c;How come you don&#x2019;t let us whack some real zoms?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because killing&#x2019;s the sort of thing you should learn from your folks,&#x201d; said Feeney.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any folks,&#x201d; Benny countered. &#x201c;My mom and dad died on First Night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ouch. Sorry, Benny&#x2014;I forgot. Point is, you got family of some kind, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess. I got &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Mr. Freaking Perfect Tom Imura&#x2019; for a brother, and I don&#x2019;t want to learn anything from him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Feeney had stared at him. &#x201c;Wow. I didn&#x2019;t know you were related to him. He&#x2019;s your brother, huh? Well, there&#x2019;s your answer, kid. Nobody better to teach you the art of killing than a professional killer like Tom Imura.&#x201d; Feeney paused and licked his lips nervously. &#x201c;I guess being his brother and all, you&#x2019;ve seen him take down a lot of zoms.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Benny said with huge annoyance. &#x201c;He never lets me watch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really? That&#x2019;s odd. Well, ask him when you turn thirteen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny had asked on his thirteenth birthday, and Tom had said no. Again. It wasn&#x2019;t a discussion. Just &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was more than two years ago, and now Benny was six weeks past his fifteenth birthday. He had four more weeks grace to find a paying job before town ordinance cut his rations by half. Benny hated being in that position, and if one more person gave him the &#x201c;fifteen and free&#x201d; speech, he was going to scream. He hated that as much as when people saw someone doing hard work and they said crap like, &#x201c;Holy smokes, he&#x2019;s going at that like he&#x2019;s fifteen and out of food.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like it was something to be happy about. Something to be proud of. Working your butt off for the rest of your life. Benny didn&#x2019;t see where the fun was in that. Okay, maybe it was marginally okay because it meant only half days of school from then on, but it still sucked.<br> <br>His buddy Lou Chong said it was a sign of the growing cultural oppression that was driving postapocalyptic humanity toward acceptance of a new slave state. Benny had no freaking idea what Chong meant or if there was even meaning in anything he said. But he nodded agreement because the look on Chong&#x2019;s face always made it seem like he knew exactly what was what.<br> <br>At home, before he even finished eating his dessert, Tom had said, &#x201c;If I want to talk about you joining the family business, are you going to chew my head off? Again?&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny stared venomous death at Tom and said, very clearly and distinctly, &#x201c;I. Don&#x2019;t. Want. To. Work. In. The. Family. Business.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that as a &#x2018;no,&#x2019; then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s a little late now to try and get me all excited about it? I asked you a zillion times to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You asked me to take you out on kills.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right! And every time I did you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom cut him off. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot more to what I do, Benny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, there probably is, and maybe I would have thought the rest was something I could deal with, but you never let me see the cool stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing &#x2018;cool&#x2019; about killing,&#x201d; Tom said sharply.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is when you&#x2019;re talking about killing zoms!&#x201d; Benny fired back.<br> <br>That stalled the conversation. Tom stalked out of the room and banged around the kitchen for a while, and Benny threw himself down on the couch.<br> <br>Tom and Benny never talked about zombies. They had every reason to, but they never did. Benny couldn&#x2019;t understand it. He hated zoms. Everyone hated them, though with Benny it was a white-hot consuming hatred that went back to his very first memory. Because it was his first memory&#x2014;a nightmare image that was there every night when he closed his eyes. It was an image that was seared into him, even though it was something he had seen as a tiny child.<br> <br>Dad and Mom.<br> <br>Mom screaming, running toward Tom, shoving a squirming Benny&#x2014;all of eighteen months&#x2014;into Tom&#x2019;s arms. Screaming and screaming. Telling him to run.<br> <br>While the thing that had been Dad pushed its way through the bedroom door that Mom had tried to block with a chair and lamps and anything else she could find.<br> <br>Benny remembered Mom screaming words, but the memory was so old and he had been so young that he didn&#x2019;t remember what any of them were. Maybe there were no words. Maybe it was just her screaming.<br> <br>Benny remembered the wet heat on his face as Tom&#x2019;s tears fell on him as they climbed out of the bedroom window. They had lived in a ranch-style house. One story. The window emptied out into a yard that was pulsing with red and blue police lights. There were more shouts and screams. The neighbors. The cops. Maybe the army. Thinking back, Benny figured it was probably the army. And the constant popping of gunfire, near and far away.<br> <br>But of all of it, Benny remembered a single last image. As Tom clutched him to his chest, Benny looked over his brother&#x2019;s shoulder at the bedroom window. Mom leaned out of the window, screaming at them as Dad&#x2019;s pale hands reached out of the shadows of the room and dragged her back out of sight.<br> <br>That was Benny&#x2019;s oldest memory. If there had been older memories, then that image had burned them away. Because he had been so young the whole thing was little more than a collage of pictures and noises, but over the years Benny had burned his brain to reclaim each fragment, to assign meaning and sense to every scrap of what he could recall. Benny remembered the hammering sound vibrating against his chest that was Tom&#x2019;s panicked heartbeat, and the long wail that was his own inarticulate cry for his mom and his dad.<br> <br>He hated Tom for running away. He hated that Tom hadn&#x2019;t stayed and helped Mom. He hated what their dad had become on that First Night all those years ago. Just as he hated what Dad had turned Mom into.<br> <br>In his mind they were no longer Mom and Dad. They were the things that had killed them. Zoms. And he hated them with an intensity that made the sun feel cold and small.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dude, what is it with you and zoms?&#x201d; Chong once asked him. &#x201c;You act like the zoms have a personal grudge against you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What, I&#x2019;m supposed to have fuzzy bunny feelings for them?&#x201d; Benny had snapped back.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Chong had conceded, &#x201c;but a little perspective would be nice. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everybody hates zoms.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chong had shrugged his bony shoulders and his dark eyes had darted away. &#x201c;Everybody hates zoms.&#x201d;<br> <br>The way Benny saw it, when your first memory was of zombies killing your parents, then you had a license to hate them as much as you wanted. He tried to explain that to Chong, but his friend wouldn&#x2019;t be drawn back into the conversation.<br> <br>A few years ago, when Benny found out that Tom was a zombie hunter, he hadn&#x2019;t been proud of his brother. As far as he was concerned, if Tom really had what it took to be a zombie hunter, he&#x2019;d have had the guts to help Mom. Instead, Tom had run away and left Mom to die. To become one of them.<br> <br>Tom came back into the living room, looked at the remains of the dessert on the table, then looked at Benny on the couch.<br> <br>&#x201c;The offer still stands,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you want to do what I do, then I&#x2019;ll take you on as an apprentice. I&#x2019;ll sign the papers so you can still get full rations.&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny gave him a long, withering stare.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be eaten by zoms than have you as my boss,&#x201d; Benny said.<br> <br>Tom sighed, turned, and trudged upstairs. After that they didn&#x2019;t talk to each other for days.</p><h2>Enough Already!: A Guide to Recovery from Alcohol and Drug Addiction</h2><p>Enough Already! is an easy read that educates alcoholics and addicts on precisely what to do to get and stay sober. After learning about the disease of alcoholism/addiction and time-tested tools of recovery, the reader is introduced to relapse prevention strategies, the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12 Step programs, and coping skills to deal with uncomfortable emotions that often lead to drug and alcohol use. This is followed by specific instructions on how to get started in recovery and a final inspiring chapter entitled &#34;The Miracle.&#34; Having years of sobriety and experience in the field of chemical dependency, Bob presents the information in this book drawing from personal and professional perspectives. Therefore, the reader learns the principles of sobriety and how to apply them in daily living through Bob&#39;s candid self-disclosure - a unique quality of this book.</p><p><i>Enough Already!</i> was written directly for those who suffer from alcohol and/or drug addiction or think they may have a problem. Very often, when alcoholics and drug addicts reach out for help by calling chemical dependence treatment centers, many are disillusioned with the high cost of such treatment. If they have inadequate insurance coverage or cannot otherwise afford it, they are referred to county-funded programs, which often lack availability. The discontent I experience when making such "empty" referrals is the drive behind this book. My vision is that referring agents can refer alcoholics and addicts to <i>Enough Already!</i> and can feel confident they have provided a resource that can help the caller right away. <p> Along with the above-mentioned use of the book as a referral source for alcohol and drug counselors, detoxification facilities, therapists, employee assistance counselors, doctors, and hotline operators, <i>Enough Already!</i> is currently being utilized as a textbook for Alcohol and Drug Studies Programs at InterCoast Colleges (five campuses), the Training Institute for Addiction Counselors, Loyola Marymount University Extension, and the United States Navy San Diego Campus. It will also be utilized as a text in Alcohol and Drug Addiction treatment centers for patients struggling with specific areas of recovery.</p>Bob Tyler has been sober since 1988 and has been working in the chemical dependence recovery field since 1990. He is certified by the California Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors (CAADAC) and will take office as their President in 2007. Bob is happily married with four wonderful children.

Eden, the USA Today Bestselling author of the Longing for Home series, LOVE REMAINS is a new romance novel set in the beloved world of Hope Springs.<br><br>For nearly a year, Tavish O&#x2019;Connor has carried the crushing weight of his family&#x2019;s future on his shoulders. He has taken on the care of his youngest brother, Finbarr, who lost his eyesight in a terrible accident. But the lad needs more than Tavish can provide. Finbarr needs hope.<br><br>Cecily Attwater specializes in hope. As a tutor to the newly blind, she has dedicated her life to helping others overcome the obstacles she herself has conquered. Her new assignment in a remote corner of Wyoming proves trickier than usual: Finbarr refuses to learn. To make matters worse, his family&#x2014;and the other Irish townspeople&#x2014;are less than thrilled to discover an Englishwoman in their haven.<br><br>Cecily&#x2019;s only hope lies in securing the cooperation of her pupil&#x2019;s brother, Tavish, who happens to be her harshest critic and quite possibly the most frustrating man she&#x2019;s ever known.<br><br>For Finbarr&#x2019;s sake, Tavish and Cecily forge an uneasy alliance that, as the weeks pass, tiptoes toward something deeper than either dares admit or face, and toward a future they know to be impossible. There can be no hope of a happy outcome for an Irish man and an English woman amongst a people reeling from violence and centuries of hatred between their two homelands.<br><br>Other Books in the Hope Springs Series:<br>Longing for Home<br>Hope Springs<br>My Dearest Love<br><br>Regency Romances:<br>The Kiss of a Stranger<br>Glimmer of Hope<br>An Unlikely Match<br>For Elise<br>All Regency Collection<br>British Isles Collection<br><br>The Jonquil Brothers series:<br>Friends and Foes<br>Drops of Gold<br>As You Are<br>A Fine Gentleman<br><br>The Lancaster Family series:<br>Seeking Persephone<br>Courting Miss Lancaster<br>Romancing Daphne<br><br>Timeless Romance Anthologies:<br>Winter Collection<br>Spring Vacation Collection<br>European Collection<br>Summer Wedding Collection<br>Love Letter Collection<br><br>Historical Westerns:<br>The Sheriffs of Savage Wells<br>Old West Collection<br>Mail Order Bride Collection<br><br>Timeless Regency Collections:<br>Summer House Party</p><p>SARAH M.
